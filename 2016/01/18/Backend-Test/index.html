<h5 id="IOC:">IOC:</h5><p>In traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the reusable code that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.</p>
<p><strong> Description </strong><br>In traditional programming, the flow of the business logic is determined by objects that are statically bound to one another. With inversion of control, the flow depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution. Such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions. This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator. In IoC, the code could also be linked statically during compilation, but finding the code to execute by reading its description from external configuration instead of with a direct reference in the code itself.</p>
<p>In dependency injection, a dependent object or module is coupled to the object it needs at run time. Which particular object will satisfy the dependency during program execution typically cannot be known at compile time using static analysis. While described in terms of object interaction here, the principle can apply to other programming methodologies besides object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>In order for the running program to bind objects to one another, the objects must possess compatible interfaces. For example, class A may delegate behavior to interface I which is implemented by class B; the program instantiates A and B, and then injects B into A.</p>
<p><strong> Benfits </strong><br>Inversion of control serves the following design purposes:</p>
<p>To decouple the execution of a task from implementation.<br>To focus a module on the task it is designed for.<br>To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on contracts.<br>To prevent side effects when replacing a module.</p>
<p>Inversion of control is sometimes facetiously referred to as the “Hollywood Principle: Don’t call us, we’ll call you”.</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming, there are several basic techniques to implement inversion of control. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a factory pattern</li>
<li>Using a service locator pattern</li>
<li>Using a dependency injection, for example<ul>
<li>A constructor injection</li>
<li>A parameter injection</li>
<li>A setter injection</li>
<li>An interface injection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using a contextualized lookup</li>
<li>Using template method design pattern</li>
<li>Using strategy design pattern</li>
</ol>
<p>In an original article by Martin Fowler, the first three different techniques are discussed. In a description about inversion of control types, the last one is mentioned. Often the contextualized lookup will be accomplished using a service locator.</p>
<p>More important than the applied technique, however, is the optimization of the purposes.</p>
<h5 id="DI">DI</h5><p>A dependency is an object that can be used (a service). An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it. The service is made part of the client’s state. Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.</p>
<p>Dependency injection allows a program design to follow the dependency inversion principle. The client delegates to external code (the injector) the responsibility of providing its dependencies. The client is not allowed to call the injector code.[2] It is the injecting code that constructs the services and calls the client to inject them. This means the client code does not need to know about the injecting code. The client does not need to know how to construct the services. The client does not need to know which actual services it is using. The client only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how the client may use the services. This separates the responsibilities of use and construction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>Inversion of Control (IoC) is more general than DI. Put simply, IoC means letting other code call you rather than insisting on doing the calling. An example of IoC without DI is the template pattern. Here polymorphism is achieved through subclassing, that is, inheritance.</p>
<p>Dependency injection implements IoC through composition so is often identical to that of the strategy pattern, but while the strategy pattern is intended for dependencies to be interchangeable throughout an object’s lifetime, in dependency injection it may be that only a single instance of a dependency is used. This still achieves polymorphism, but through delegation and composition.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency injection allows a client the flexibility of being configurable. Only the client’s behavior is fixed. The client may act on anything that supports the intrinsic interface the client expects.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can be used to externalize a system’s configuration details into configuration files allowing the system to be reconfigured without recompilation. Separate configurations can be written for different situations that require different implementations of components. This includes, but is not limited to, testing.</li>
<li>Because dependency injection doesn’t require any change in code behavior it can be applied to legacy code as a refactoring. The result is clients that are more independent and that are easier to unit test in isolation using stubs or mock objects that simulate other objects not under test. This ease of testing is often the first benefit noticed when using dependency injection.</li>
<li>Dependency injection allows a client to remove all knowledge of a concrete implementation that it needs to use. This helps isolate the client from the impact of design changes and defects. It promotes reusability, testability and maintainability.[20]</li>
<li>Reduction of boilerplate code in the application objects since all work to initialize or set up dependencies is handled by a provider component.[20]</li>
<li>Dependency injection allows concurrent or independent development. Two developers can independently develop classes that use each other, while only needing to know the interface the classes will communicate through. Plugins are often developed by third party shops that never even talk to the developers who created the product that uses the plugins.</li>
<li>Dependency Injection decreases coupling between a class and its dependency.[21][22]</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency injection creates clients that demand configuration details be supplied by construction code. This can be onerous when obvious defaults are available.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can make code difficult to trace (read) because it separates behavior from construction. This means developers must refer to more files to follow how a system performs.</li>
<li>Dependency injection typically requires more upfront development effort since one can not summon into being something right when and where it is needed but must ask that it be injected and then ensure that it is injected.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can cause an explosion of types, especially in languages that have explicit interface types, like Java and C# [23]</li>
<li>Dependency injection forces complexity to move out of classes and into the linkages between classes which might not always be desirable or easily managed.[24]</li>
<li>Ironically, dependency injection can encourage dependence on a dependency injection framework.[24][25][26]</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependency injection is a specific type of IoC using contextualized lookup</p>
<p>Such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions.<br>This runtime binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service<br>locator .

<p>Index<br>A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a<br>database table at the cost of additional writes and the use of more storage space to maintain<br>the extra copy of data.<br>Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table<br>every time a database table is accessed.<br>Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table , providing the basis for<br>both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records.<br>An index is a copy of select columns of data from a table that can be searched very efficiently<br>that also includes a low level disk block address or direct link to the complete row of data it was<br>copied from.<br>With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index.<br>There can therefore be only one clustered index.<br>With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can<br>have many non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to<br>write new records.<br>It is generally faster to read from a clustered index if you want to get back all the columns. You<br>do not have to go first to the index and then to the table.<br>Writing to a table with a clustered index can be slower, if there is a need to rearrange the data.</p>
<p>Clustered</p>
<p>Clustering alters the data block into a certain distinct order to match the index, resulting in the<br>row data being stored in order. Therefore, only one clustered index can be created on a given<br>database table. Clustered indices can greatly increase overall speed of retrieval, but usually<br>only where the data is accessed sequentially in the same or reverse order of the clustered<br>index, or when a range of items is selected.<br>Since the physical records are in this sort order on disk, the next row item in the sequence is<br>immediately before or after the last one, and so fewer data block reads are required. The<br>primary feature of a clustered index is therefore the ordering of the physical data rows in<br>accordance with the index blocks that point to them. Some databases separate the data and<br>index blocks into separate files, others put two completely different data blocks within the same<br>physical file(s).<br>Sql Server Profiler</p>

<p>GC</p>
<p>In computer science , garbage collection ( GC ) is a form of automatic memory management .<br>The garbage collector , or just collector , attempts to reclaim garbage , or memory occupied by<br>objects that are no longer in use by the program . Garbage collection was invented by John<br>McCarthy around 1959 to solve problems in Lisp.</p>
<p>Garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of manual memory management , which<br>requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory<br>system. However, many systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques<br>such as stack allocation and region inference . Like other memory management techniques,<br>garbage collection may take a significant proportion of total processing time in a program and<br>can thus have significant influence on performance.</p>
<p>Resources other than memory, such as network sockets , database handles , user interaction<br>windows, and file and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection.<br>Methods used to manage such resources, particularly destructors , may suffice to manage<br>memory as well, leaving no need for GC. Some GC systems allow such other resources to be<br>associated with a region of memory that, when collected, causes the other resource to be<br>reclaimed; this is called finalization . Finalization may introduce complications limiting its<br>usability, such as intolerable latency between disuse and reclaim of especially limited resources,<br>or a lack of control over which thread performs the work of reclaiming.</p>
<p>Advantages<br>Garbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory deallocation. As a<br>result, certain categories of bugs are eliminated or substantially reduced:</p>
<p>● Dangling pointer bugs , which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are<br>still pointers to it, and one of those pointers is dereferenced. By then the memory<br>may have been reassigned to another use, with unpredictable results.</p>
<p>● Double free bugs , which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory<br>that has already been freed, and perhaps already been allocated again.</p>
<p>● Certain kinds of memory leaks , in which a program fails to free memory occupied by<br>objects that have become unreachable , which can lead to memory exhaustion.<br>(Garbage collection typically does not deal with the unbounded accumulation of data<br>that is reachable, but that will actually not be used by the program.)</p>
<p>● Efficient implementations of persistent data structures<br>Some of the bugs addressed by garbage collection can have security implications.</p>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<p>Typically, garbage collection has certain disadvantages:</p>
<p>● Garbage collection consumes computing resources in deciding which memory to<br>free, even though the programmer may have already known this information. The<br>penalty for the convenience of not annotating object lifetime manually in the source<br>code is overhead , which can lead to decreased or uneven performance. Interaction<br>with memory hierarchy effects can make this overhead intolerable in circumstances<br>that are hard to predict or to detect in routine testing.</p>
<p>● The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting<br>in stalls scattered throughout a session. Unpredictable stalls can be unacceptable in<br>realtime environments , in transaction processing , or in interactive programs.<br>Incremental, concurrent, and realtime garbage collectors address these problems, with varying tradeoffs.</p>
<p>● Nondeterministic GC is incompatible with RAII based management of nonGCed<br>resources. As a result, the need for explicit manual resource management<br>(release/close) for nonGCed resources becomes transitive to composition. That is:<br>in a nondeterministic GC system, if a resource or a resourcelike<br>object requires manual resource management (release/close), and this object is used as ‘part of’<br>another object, then the composed object will also become a resourcelike<br>object that itself requires manual resource management (release/close).</p>
<p>The ASP.NET MVC framework offers the following advantages:</p>
<p>● It makes it easier to manage complexity by dividing an application into the model, the<br>view, and the controller.</p>
<p>● It does not use view state or serverbased forms. This makes the MVC framework ideal<br>for developers who want full control over the behavior of an application.</p>
<p>● It uses a Front Controller pattern that processes Web application requests through a<br>single controller. This enables you to design an application that supports a rich routing<br>infrastructure. For more information, see Front Controller on the MSDN Web site.</p>
<p>● It provides better support for testdriven development (TDD).</p>
<p>● It works well for Web applications that are supported by large teams of developers and<br>Web designers who need a high degree of control over the application behavior.</p>
<p>Interface injection comparison</p>
<p>The advantage of interface injection is that dependencies can be completely ignorant of their clients yet can still receive a reference to a new client and, using it, send a reference-to-self back to the client. In this way, the dependencies become injectors. The key is that the injecting method (which could just be a classic setter method) is provided through an interface.</p>
<p>An assembler is still needed to introduce the client and its dependencies. The assembler would take a reference to the client, cast it to the setter interface that sets that dependency, and pass it to that dependency object which would turn around and pass a reference-to-self back to the client.</p>
<p>For interface injection to have value, the dependency must do something in addition to simply passing back a reference to itself. This could be acting as a factory or sub-assembler to resolve other dependencies, thus abstracting some details from the main assembler. It could be reference-counting so that the dependency knows how many clients are using it. If the dependency maintains a collection of clients, it could later inject them all with a different instance of itself.</p>
<p>Interface injection[edit]<br>This is simply the client publishing a role interface to the setter methods of the client’s dependencies. It can be used to establish how the injector should talk to the client when injecting dependencies.</p>
