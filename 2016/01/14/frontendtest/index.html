<h3 id="HTML_Questions:">HTML Questions:</h3><h4 id="What_does_a_doctype_do?">What does a <code>doctype</code> do?</h4><p>It’s an integral part of HTML as defined in the specification:</p>
<p>A DOCTYPE is a required preamble.</p>
<p>DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications.</p>

<h4 id="What’s_the_difference_between_standards_mode_and_quirks_mode?">What’s the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?</h4><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode" target="_blank" rel="external">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode</a><br><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html</a></p>
<p>The two ’modes’ modern browsers can use to interpret your CSS.</p>
<p>In the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two versions: One for Netscape Navigator, and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer. When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.</p>
<p>There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode. In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. In full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. In almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.</p>
<p><strong>How do browsers determine which mode to use?</strong></p>
<p>For HTML documents, browsers use a DOCTYPE in the beginning of the document to decide whether to handle it in quirks mode or standards mode. To ensure that your page uses full standards mode, make sure that your page has a DOCTYPE </p>
<p>The DOCTYPE shown in the example, &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, is the simplest possible, and the one recommended by HTML5. Earlier versions of the HTML standard recommended other variants, but all existing browsers today will use full standards mode for this DOCTYPE, even the dated Internet Explorer 6. There are no valid reasons to use a more complicated DOCTYPE. If you do use another DOCTYPE, you may risk choosing one which triggers almost standards mode or quirks mode.</p>
<p>Make sure you put the DOCTYPE right at the beginning of your HTML document. Anything before the DOCTYPE, like a comment or an XML declaration will trigger quirks mode in Internet Explorer 9 and older.</p>
<p>In HTML5, the only purpose of the DOCTYPE is to activate full standards mode. Older versions of the HTML standard gave additional meaning to the DOCTYPE, but no browser has ever used the DOCTYPE for anything other than switching between quirks mode and standards mode.</p>
<p><strong>XHTML</strong></p>
<p>If you serve your page as XHTML using the application/xhtml+xml MIME type in the Content-Type HTTP header, you do not need a DOCTYPE to enable standards mode, as such documents always use full standards mode. Note however that serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml will cause Internet Explorer 8 to show a download dialog box for an unknown format instead of displaying your page, as the first version of Internet Explorer with support for XHTML is Internet Explorer 9.</p>
<p>If you serve XHTML-like content using the text/html MIME type, browsers will read it as HTML, and you will need the DOCTYPE to use standards mode.</p>
<p><strong>How do I see which mode is used?</strong></p>
<p>In Firefox, select View Page Info from the context menu, and look for Render Mode.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, press F12, and look for Document Mode.</p>
<h4 id="What’s_the_difference_between_HTML_and_XHTML?">What’s the difference between HTML and XHTML?</h4><p>XHTML is the XML version of HTML.</p>
<p>To understand this answer you have to know what XML is : it’s a markup language designed to format data in a way that’s easy to understand for a human, and also easy to parse for a machine.</p>
<p>XML is also a meta-language. This means that a lot of languages are based on XML, with rules and grammar defined to make a language with specific purpose from XML. Some well-known  examples are OpenMath, MML, XPath, XQuery, …</p>
<p>Now at the beginning of the web, the markup language that was used for web pages was HTML. It looks a lot like XML but it’s not an XML language because it does not respect the XML standard.</p>
<p>Later, XHTML was invented with respect to the XML standard. It is more strict than html because you have to respect all the xml rules (Closing tag for each opening tag, attributes have to have a value etc.)</p>
<p>So the short answer is : xHTML is XML, HTML is not.</p>
<p>XHTML is not so much different from HTML 4.01 standard. The major differences are:</p>
<p><strong>Document Structure</strong><br><em>XHTML DOCTYPE is mandatory
</em>The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory<br><em><html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory<br><strong>XHTML Elements</strong>
</body></title></head></html></em>XHTML elements must be properly nested<br><em>XHTML elements must always be closed
</em>XHTML elements must be in lowercase<br><em>XHTML documents must have one root element<br><strong>XHTML Attributes</strong>
</em>Attribute names must be in lower case<br><em>Attribute values must be quoted
</em>Attribute minimization is forbidden</html></p>
<p>Basically, XHTML is HTML (all the html tags are found in XHTML) that follows the rules of XML (because it is a family of XML).</p>
<h4 id="Are_there_any_problems_with_serving_pages_as_application/xhtml+xml?">Are there any problems with serving pages as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>?</h4><p>When you’re coding XHTML, you should deliver it as application/xhtml+xml. The problem is however, that once you do that, IE 6 &amp; 7 break horribly… For your pages to render properly in those browsers, you’d need to set the mime type to text/html. Some very bright people have thought this problem in the past and came up with a real good solution in PHP, which you can find here: serving up XHTML with the correct MIME type.</p>
<p>WordPress though is always served as XHTML, so if possible, it should send the proper MIME type. I wrote a small plugin that does that: XHTML MIME type plugin. It doesn’t work on this blog yet because of some modifications I’ve done, but I’ll try to get it working.</p>
<p>I use content negotiation to switch between application/xhtml+xml and text/html just like you describe, without noticing any problems with search bots. Strictly though, you should take into account the q values in the accept header that indicates the preference of the user agent to each content type. If a user agent prefers to accept text/html but will accept application/xhtml+xml as an alternate, then for greatest safety you should have the page served as text/html.</p>
<p>One problem with content negotiation (and with serving different content/headers to different user-agents) is proxy servers. Considering the following; I ran into this back in the Netscape 4 days and have been shy of server side sniffing ever since.</p>
<p>User A downloads your page with Firefox, and gets a XHTML/XML Content-Type. The user’s ISP has a proxy server between the user and your site, so this page is now cached.</p>
<p>User B, same ISP, requests your page using Internet Explorer. The request hits the proxy first, the proxy says “hey, I have that page, here it is; as application/xhtml+xml”. User B is prompted to download the file (as IE will download anything sent as application/xhtml+xml.</p>
<p>You can get around this particular issue by using the Vary Header, as described in this 456 Berea Street article. I also assume that proxy servers have gotten a bit smarter about auto detecting these things.</p>
<p>Here’s where the CF that is HTML/XHTML starts to creep in. When you use content negotiation to serve application/xhtml+xml to one set of user-agents, and text/html to another set of user agents, you’re relying on all the proxies between your server and your users to be well behaved.</p>
<p>Even if all the proxy servers in the world were smart enough to recognize the Vary header (they aren’t) you still have to contend with the computer janitors of the world. There are a lot of smart, talented, and dedicated IT professionals in the world. There are more not so smart people who spend their days double clicking installer applications and thinking “The Internet” is that blue E in their menu. A mis-configured proxy could still improperly cache pages and headers, leaving you out of luck.</p>

<h4 id="What_are_data-_attributes_good_for?">What are <code>data-</code> attributes good for?</h4><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes" target="_blank" rel="external">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes</a></p>
<p>HTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as classList, non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or setUserData.</p>
<p>HTML Syntax<br>The syntax is simple. Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute. Say you have an article and you want to store some extra information that doesn’t have any visual representation. Just use data attributes for that:</p>
<article id="electriccars" data-columns="3" data-index-number="12314" data-parent="cars"><br>…<br></article>

<p>JavaScript Access</p>
<p>Reading the values of these attributes out in JavaScript is also very simple. You could use getAttribute() with their full HTML name to read them, but the standard defines a simpler way: a DOMStringMap you can read out via a dataset property.</p>
<p>To get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note that dashes are converted to camelCase).</p>
<p>var article = document.getElementById(‘electriccars’);</p>
<p>article.dataset.columns // “3”<br>article.dataset.indexNumber // “12314”<br>article.dataset.parent // “cars”<br>Each property is a string and can be read and written. In the above case setting article.dataset.columns = 5 would change that attribute to “5”.</p>
<p>CSS Access<br>Note that, as data attributes are plain HTML attributes, you can even access them from CSS. For example to show the parent data on the article you can use generated content in CSS with the attr() function:</p>
<p>article::before {<br>  content: attr(data-parent);<br>}<br>You can also use the attribute selectors in CSS to change styles according to the data:</p>
<p>article[data-columns=’3’] {<br>  width: 400px;<br>}<br>article[data-columns=’4’] {<br>  width: 600px;<br>}<br>You can see all this working together. </p>
<p>Data attributes can also be stored to contain information that is constantly changing, like scores in a game. Using the CSS selectors and JavaScript access here this allows you to build some nifty effects without having to write your own display routines. See this screencast for an example using generated content and CSS transitions (JSBin example).</p>
<p>Since data values are strings, all values must have quotes or else the styling won’t have any effect.</p>
<h4 id="Consider_HTML5_as_an_open_web_platform-_What_are_the_building_blocks_of_HTML5?">Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?</h4><h4 id="Describe_the_difference_between_a_cookie,_sessionStorage_and_localStorage-">Describe the difference between a <code>cookie</code>, <code>sessionStorage</code> and <code>localStorage</code>.</h4><p>localStorage and sessionStorage are both so-called WebStorages and features of HTML5.</p>
<p>localStorage stores information as long as the user does not delete them.</p>
<p>sessionStorage stores information as long as the session goes. Usually until the user closes the tab/browser.</p>
<p>cookies are simply cookies, which are supported by older browsers and usually are a fallback for frameworks that use the above mentioned WebStorages.</p>
<p>In contrast cookies can store way less information then WebStorages and the information in WebStorages is never transferred to the server.</p>
<p>This is an extremely broad scope question, and a lot of the pros/cons will be contextual to the situation.</p>
<p>In all cases these storage mechanisms will be specific to an individual browser on an individual computer/device. Any requirement to store data on an ongoing basis across sessions will need to involve your application server side - most likely using a database, but possibly XML or a text/CSV file.</p>
<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all client storage solutions. Session data is held on the server where it remains under your direct control.</p>
<p>localStorage and sessionStorage<br>localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name persists) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the window is closed) - it does however survive page reloads (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network).</p>
<p>Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.</p>
<p>localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security related data within applications.</p>
<p>Cookies<br>This is also true for cookies, these can be trivially tampered with by the user, and data can also be read from them in plain text - so if you are wanting to store sensitive data then session is really your only option. If you are not using SSL, cookie information can also be intercepted in transit, especially on an open wifi.</p>
<p>On the positive side cookies can have a degree of protection applied from security risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)/Script injection by setting an HTTP only flag which means modern (supporting) browsers will prevent access to the cookies and values from JavaScript (this will also prevent your own, legitimate, JavaScript from accessing them). This is especially important with authentication cookies, which are used to store a token containing details of the user who is logged on - if you have a copy of that cookie then for all intents and purposes you become that user as far as the web application is concerned, and have the same access to data and functionality the user has.</p>
<p>As cookies are used for authentication purposes and persistence of user data, all cookies valid for a page are sent from the browser to the server for every request to the same domain - this includes the original page request, any subsequent Ajax requests, all images, stylesheets, scripts and fonts. For this reason cookies should not be used to store large amounts of information. Browser may also impose limits on the size of information that can be stored in cookies. Typically cookies are used to store identifying tokens for authentication, session and advertising tracking. The tokens are typically not human readable information in and of themselves, but encrypted identifiers linked to your application or database.</p>
<p>localStorage vs. sessionStorage vs. Cookies<br>In terms of capabilities, cookies only allow you to store strings. sessionStorage and localStorage allow you to store JavaScript primitives but not Objects or Arrays (it is possible to JSON serialise them to store them using the APIs). Session storage will generally allow you to store any primitives or objects supported by your Server Side language/framework.</p>
<p>Client-side vs. Server-side<br>As HTTP is a stateless protocol - web applications have no way of identifying a user from previous visits on returning to the web site - session data usually relies on a cookie token to identify the user for repeat visits (although rarely URL parameters may be used for the same purpose). Data will usually have a sliding expiry time (renewed each time the user visits), and depending on your server/framework data will either be stored in-process (meaning data will be lost if the web server crashes or is restarted) or externally in a state server or database. This is also necessary when using a web-farm (more than one server for a given website).</p>
<p>As session data is completely controlled by your application (server side) it is the best place for anything sensitive or secure in nature.</p>
<p>The obvious disadvantage with server side data is scalability - server resources are required for each user for the duration of the session, and that any data needed client side must be sent with each request. As the server has no way of knowing if a user navigates to another site or closes their browser, session data must expire after a given time to avoid all server resources being taken up by abandoned sessions. When using session data you should therefore be aware of the possibility that data will have expired and been lost, especially on pages with long forms. It will also be lost if the user deletes their cookies or switches browsers/devices.</p>
<p>Some web frameworks/developers use hidden HTML inputs to persist data from one page of a form to another to avoid session expiration.</p>
<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all subject to “same-origin” rules which means browsers should prevent access to the data except from the domain that set the information to start with.</p>

<p>\<script\><br>Let’s start by defining what \<script\> without any attributes does. The HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it’s external). The script will then be executed before parsing is resumed.</p>
<p>\<script async="" \><br>async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.</p>
<p>\<script defer\><br>defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. defer scripts are also guarenteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.</p>
<p>When should I use what?<br>Typically you want to use async where possible, then defer then no attribute. Here are some general rules to follow:<br>If the script is modular and does not rely on any scripts then use async.<br>If the script relies upon or is relied upon by another script then use defer.<br>If the script is small and is relied upon by an async script then use an inline script with no attributes placed above the async scripts.</p>

Do you know any exceptions?</h4><p>The reasoning for <link> at the top is browsers have to reflow the layout as CSS files load (if they’re not in the <head>) moving elements around while the user is trying to interact with the page. For \<script\> files at the end, browsers have to (in most cases) block processing the HTML while a JavaScript file is loaded and run in case it makes in Write() calls (which you’re not supposed to do anymore these days); if the \<script\> tag is at the end, the browser can still display all of the HTML above the \<script\> tags while it is processing the JavaScript. </p>
<p>Just to add on to what jdelStrother has mentioned about w3 specs and ARTstudio about browser rendering.</p>
<p>It is recommended because when you have the CSS declared before <body> starts, your styles has actually loaded already. So very quickly users see something appear on their screen (e.g. background colors). If not, users see blank screen for some time before the CSS reaches the user.</p>
<p>Also, if you leave the the styles somewhere in the <body>, the browser has to re-render the page (new and old when loading) when the styles declared has been parsed.</p>

Bubbling events will then trigger any additional event listeners found by following the EventTarget&#39;s parent chain upward, checking for any event listeners registered on each successive EventTarget. This upward propagation will continue up to and including the Document.&#10;Event bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in browsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn). This is event delegation. Here&#39;s an example of it in practice:&#10;&#10;&#60;ul onclick=&#34;alert(event.type + &#39;!&#39;)&#34;&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;One&#60;/li&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;Two&#60;/li&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;Three&#60;/li&#62;&#10;&#60;/ul&#62;&#10;With that example if you were to click on any of the child &#60;li&#62; nodes, you would see an alert of &#34;click!&#34;, even though there is no click handler bound to the &#60;li&#62; you clicked on. If we bound onclick=&#34;...&#34; to each &#60;li&#62; you would get the same effect.&#10;&#10;So what&#39;s the benefit?&#10;&#10;Imagine you now have a need to dynamically add new &#60;li&#62; items to the above list via DOM manipulation:&#10;&#10;var newLi = document.createElement(&#39;li&#39;);&#10;newLi.innerHTML = &#39;Four&#39;;&#10;myUL.appendChild(newLi);&#10;Without using event delegation you would have to &#34;rebind&#34; the &#34;onclick&#34; event handler to the new &#60;li&#62; element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. With event delegation you don&#39;t need to do anything. Just add the new &#60;li&#62; to the list and you&#39;re done.&#10;&#10;This is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound to many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or removed in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings can be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, and code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be decoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.&#10;&#10;Another benefit to event delegation is that the total memory footprint used by event listeners goes down (since the number of event bindings go down). It may not make much of a difference to small pages that unload often (i.e. user&#39;s navigate to different pages often). But for long-lived applications it can be significant. There are some really difficult-to-track-down situations when elements removed from the DOM still claim memory (i.e. they leak), and often this leaked memory is tied to an event binding. With event delegation you&#39;re free to destroy child elements without risk of forgetting to &#34;unbind&#34; their event listeners (since the listener is on the ancestor). These types of memory leaks can then be contained (if not eliminated, which is freaking hard to do sometimes. IE I&#39;m looking at you).&#10;&#10;Here are some better concrete code examples of event delegation:&#10;&#10;How JavaScript Event Delegation Works&#10;&#10;https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate&#10;&#10;Event Delegation versus Event Handling&#10;jQuery.delegate is event delegation + selector specification&#10;jQuery.on uses event delegation when passed a selector as the 2nd parameter&#10;Event delegation without a JavaScript library&#10;Closures vs Event delegation: takes a look at the pros of not converting code to use event delegation&#10;Interesting approach PPK uncovered for delegating the focus and blur events (which do not bubble)&#10;&#10;&#10;#### Explain how `this` works in JavaScript&#10;&#10;http://davidshariff.com/blog/javascript-this-keyword/&#10;&#10;JavaScript&#8217;s &#8216;this&#8217; Keyword&#10;&#10;A commonly used feature of JavaScript is the &#8220;this&#8221; keyword, but it is often also one of the most confused and misinterpreted features of the language. What does &#8220;this&#8221; actually mean and how is it decided?&#10;&#10;This article tries to clear up the confusion and explain the answer in a clear fashion.&#10;&#10;The &#8220;this&#8221; keyword is not new to those who have programmed in other languages, and more often than not it refers to the new object created when instantiating a class via it&#8217;s constructor. For example, if I have a class Boat(), which has a method moveBoat(), when refering to &#8220;this&#8221; inside of the moveBoat() method, we are actually accessing the newly created object of Boat().&#10;&#10;In JavaScript, we also have this concept inside a Function constructor when it is invoked using the &#8220;new&#8221; keyword, however it is not the only rule and &#8220;this&#8221; can often refer to a different object from a different execution context. If you are not familiar with JavaScript&#8217;s execution context, I recommend you read my other post on the topic here. Enough talking, let&#8217;s see some JavaScript examples:&#10;&#10;```javascript&#10;// global scope&#10;&#10;foo = &#39;abc&#39;;&#10;alert(foo); // abc&#10;&#10;this.foo = &#39;def&#39;;&#10;alert(foo); // def</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li>

<p>Whenever you use the keyword “this” in the global context (not inside a function), it always refers to the global object. Now let’s look at the value of “this” inside a function:</p>

<p>\<script\><br>Let’s start by defining what \<script\> without any attributes does. The HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it’s external). The script will then be executed before parsing is resumed.</p>
<p>\<script async="" \><br>async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.</p>
<p>\<script defer\><br>defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. defer scripts are also guarenteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.</p>
<p>When should I use what?<br>Typically you want to use async where possible, then defer then no attribute. Here are some general rules to follow:<br>If the script is modular and does not rely on any scripts then use async.<br>If the script relies upon or is relied upon by another script then use defer.<br>If the script is small and is relied upon by an async script then use an inline script with no attributes placed above the async scripts.</p>
<h4 id="Why_is_it_generally_a_good_idea_to_position_CSS_&lt;link&gt;s_between_&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;_and_JS_\&lt;script\&gt;s_just_before_&lt;/body&gt;?_Do_you_know_any_exceptions?">Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>s between <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> and JS <code>\&lt;script\&gt;</code>s just before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>? Do you know any exceptions?</h4><p>The reasoning for <link> at the top is browsers have to reflow the layout as CSS files load (if they’re not in the <head>) moving elements around while the user is trying to interact with the page. For \<script\> files at the end, browsers have to (in most cases) block processing the HTML while a JavaScript file is loaded and run in case it makes in Write() calls (which you’re not supposed to do anymore these days); if the \<script\> tag is at the end, the browser can still display all of the HTML above the \<script\> tags while it is processing the JavaScript. </p>
<p>Just to add on to what jdelStrother has mentioned about w3 specs and ARTstudio about browser rendering.</p>
<p>It is recommended because when you have the CSS declared before <body> starts, your styles has actually loaded already. So very quickly users see something appear on their screen (e.g. background colors). If not, users see blank screen for some time before the CSS reaches the user.</p>
<p>Also, if you leave the the styles somewhere in the <body>, the browser has to re-render the page (new and old when loading) when the styles declared has been parsed.</p>

Bubbling events will then trigger any additional event listeners found by following the EventTarget&#39;s parent chain upward, checking for any event listeners registered on each successive EventTarget. This upward propagation will continue up to and including the Document.&#10;Event bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in browsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn). This is event delegation. Here&#39;s an example of it in practice:&#10;&#10;&#60;ul onclick=&#34;alert(event.type + &#39;!&#39;)&#34;&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;One&#60;/li&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;Two&#60;/li&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;Three&#60;/li&#62;&#10;&#60;/ul&#62;&#10;With that example if you were to click on any of the child &#60;li&#62; nodes, you would see an alert of &#34;click!&#34;, even though there is no click handler bound to the &#60;li&#62; you clicked on. If we bound onclick=&#34;...&#34; to each &#60;li&#62; you would get the same effect.&#10;&#10;So what&#39;s the benefit?&#10;&#10;Imagine you now have a need to dynamically add new &#60;li&#62; items to the above list via DOM manipulation:&#10;&#10;var newLi = document.createElement(&#39;li&#39;);&#10;newLi.innerHTML = &#39;Four&#39;;&#10;myUL.appendChild(newLi);&#10;Without using event delegation you would have to &#34;rebind&#34; the &#34;onclick&#34; event handler to the new &#60;li&#62; element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. With event delegation you don&#39;t need to do anything. Just add the new &#60;li&#62; to the list and you&#39;re done.&#10;&#10;This is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound to many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or removed in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings can be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, and code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be decoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.&#10;&#10;Another benefit to event delegation is that the total memory footprint used by event listeners goes down (since the number of event bindings go down). It may not make much of a difference to small pages that unload often (i.e. user&#39;s navigate to different pages often). But for long-lived applications it can be significant. There are some really difficult-to-track-down situations when elements removed from the DOM still claim memory (i.e. they leak), and often this leaked memory is tied to an event binding. With event delegation you&#39;re free to destroy child elements without risk of forgetting to &#34;unbind&#34; their event listeners (since the listener is on the ancestor). These types of memory leaks can then be contained (if not eliminated, which is freaking hard to do sometimes. IE I&#39;m looking at you).&#10;&#10;Here are some better concrete code examples of event delegation:&#10;&#10;How JavaScript Event Delegation Works&#10;&#10;https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate&#10;&#10;Event Delegation versus Event Handling&#10;jQuery.delegate is event delegation + selector specification&#10;jQuery.on uses event delegation when passed a selector as the 2nd parameter&#10;Event delegation without a JavaScript library&#10;Closures vs Event delegation: takes a look at the pros of not converting code to use event delegation&#10;Interesting approach PPK uncovered for delegating the focus and blur events (which do not bubble)&#10;&#10;&#10;#### Explain how `this` works in JavaScript&#10;&#10;http://davidshariff.com/blog/javascript-this-keyword/&#10;&#10;JavaScript&#8217;s &#8216;this&#8217; Keyword&#10;&#10;A commonly used feature of JavaScript is the &#8220;this&#8221; keyword, but it is often also one of the most confused and misinterpreted features of the language. What does &#8220;this&#8221; actually mean and how is it decided?&#10;&#10;This article tries to clear up the confusion and explain the answer in a clear fashion.&#10;&#10;The &#8220;this&#8221; keyword is not new to those who have programmed in other languages, and more often than not it refers to the new object created when instantiating a class via it&#8217;s constructor. For example, if I have a class Boat(), which has a method moveBoat(), when refering to &#8220;this&#8221; inside of the moveBoat() method, we are actually accessing the newly created object of Boat().&#10;&#10;In JavaScript, we also have this concept inside a Function constructor when it is invoked using the &#8220;new&#8221; keyword, however it is not the only rule and &#8220;this&#8221; can often refer to a different object from a different execution context. If you are not familiar with JavaScript&#8217;s execution context, I recommend you read my other post on the topic here. Enough talking, let&#8217;s see some JavaScript examples:&#10;&#10;```javascript&#10;// global scope&#10;&#10;foo = &#39;abc&#39;;&#10;alert(foo); // abc&#10;&#10;this.foo = &#39;def&#39;;&#10;alert(foo); // def</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you use the keyword “this” in the global context (not inside a function), it always refers to the global object. Now let’s look at the value of “this” inside a function:</p>
