          <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Reflection can be used for observing and modifying program execution at runtime. </p>
<p>A reflection-oriented program component can monitor the execution of an enclosure of code and can modify itself according to a desired goal related to that enclosure. </p>
<p>This is typically accomplished by dynamically assigning program code at runtime.</p>
<p>In object oriented programming languages such as Java, reflection allows inspection of classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime without knowing the names of the interfaces, fields, methods at compile time. </p>
<p>It also allows instantiation of new objects and invocation of methods.</p>
<p>Reflection can also be used to adapt a given program to different situations dynamically.</p>
<p>For example, consider an application that uses two different classes X and Y interchangeably to perform similar operations.</p>
<p>Without reflection-oriented programming, the application might be hard-coded to call method names of class X and class Y. </p>
<p>However, using the reflection-oriented programming paradigm, the application could be designed and written to utilize reflection in order to invoke methods in classes X and Y without hard-coding method names. </p>
<p>Reflection-oriented programming almost always requires additional knowledge, framework, relational mapping, and object relevance in order to take advantage of more generic code execution.</p>
<p>Reflection is often used as part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.</p>
<p>Reflection is also a key strategy for metaprogramming.</p>
<p>In some object-oriented programming languages, such as C# and Java, reflection can be used to override member accessibility rules. </p>
<p>For example, reflection makes it possible to change the value of a field marked “private” in a third-party library’s class.</p>
<h4 id="Implementation">Implementation</h4><p>A language supporting reflection provides a number of features available at runtime that would otherwise be difficult to accomplish in a lower-level language. </p>
<p>Some of these features are the abilities to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discover and modify source code constructions (such as code blocks, classes, methods, protocols, etc.) as a first-class object at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Convert a string matching the symbolic name of a class or function into a reference to or invocation of that class or function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluate a string as if it were a source code statement at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new interpreter for the language’s bytecode to give a new meaning or purpose for a programming construct.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These features can be implemented in different ways.</p>
<p>In MOO, reflection forms a natural part of everyday programming idiom. </p>
<p>When verbs (methods) are called, various variables such as verb (the name of the verb being called) and this (the object on which the verb is called) are populated to give the context of the call.</p>
<p>Security is typically managed by accessing the caller stack programmatically:</p>
<p>Since callers() is a list of the methods by which the current verb was eventually called, performing tests on callers()[1] (the command invoked by the original user) allows the verb to protect itself against unauthorised use.</p>
<p>Compiled languages rely on their runtime system to provide information about the source code. </p>
<p>A compiled Objective-C executable, for example, records the names of all methods in a block of the executable, providing a table to correspond these with the underlying methods (or selectors for these methods) compiled into the program. </p>
<p>In a compiled language that supports runtime creation of functions, such as Common Lisp, the runtime environment must include a compiler or an interpreter.</p>
<p>Reflection can be implemented for languages not having built-in reflection facilities by using a program transformation system to define automated source code changes.</p>

<p>The derived type, Contact, is a PdaItem and can be assigned directly to a variable of type PdaItem. </p>
<p>This is known as an <strong>implicit conversion</strong> because no cast operator is required and the conversion will, on principle, always succeed; it will not throw an exception.</p>
<p>The reverse, however, is not true. </p>
<p>A PdaItem is not necessarily a Contact; it could be an Appointment or some other derived type. </p>
<p>Therefore, casting from the base type to the derived type requires an <strong>explicit cast</strong>, which at runtime could fail. </p>
<p>To perform an explicit cast, identify the target type within parentheses prior to the original reference.</p>
<p>An implicit conversion to a base class <strong>does not instantiate a new instance</strong>. </p>
<p>Instead, the same instance is <strong>simply referred to as the base type</strong> and the capabilities (the accessible members) are those of the base type.</p>
<p>Similarly, casting down from the base class to the derived class simply begins referring to the type more specifically, expanding the available operations. </p>
<p>The restriction is that the actual instantiated type must be an instance of the targeted type (or something derived from it).</p>

<p>A subtlety shown in the Contact.Load() method is worth noting. Developers are often surprised that from code within Contact it is not possible to access the protected ObjectKey of an explicit PdaItem, even though Contact derives from PdaItem. The reason is that a PdaItem could potentially be an Address, and Contact should not be able to access protected members of Address. Therefore, encapsulation prevents Contact from potentially modifying the ObjectKey of an Address. A successful cast to Contact will bypass the restriction as shown. The governing rule is that accessing a protected member from a derived class requires compile-time determination that the protected member is an instance of the derived class (or a class further derived from it).</p>

<h2 id="Difference_between_value_type_and_reference_type">Difference between value type and reference type</h2><h3 id="Value_Types">Value Types</h3><p><strong>Variables of value types directly contain their values, as shown in Figure 8.1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The variable name is associated directly with the storage location in memory where the value is stored.</strong></p>
<p>Because of this, when a second variable is assigned the value of an original variable, a copy of the original variable’s value is made to the storage location associated with the second variable.</p>
<p>Two variables never refer to the same storage location (unless one or both are an out or ref parameter, which are, by definition, aliases for another variable). </p>
<p>So, changing the value of the original variable will not affect the value in the second variable, since each variable is associated with a different storage location. </p>
<p>Consequently, changing the value of one value type variable cannot affect the value of any other value type variable.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/08fig01.jpg" alt="ValueTypes"></p>
<p>A value type variable is like a piece of paper that has a number written on it. </p>
<p>If you want to change the number, you can erase it and replace it with a different number. </p>
<p>If you have a second piece of paper, you can copy the number from the first piece of paper, but the two pieces of paper are then independent; erasing and replacing the number on one of them does not change the other.</p>
<p>Similarly, passing an instance of a value type to a method such as Console.WriteLine() will also result in a memory copy from the storage location associated with the argument to the storage location associated with the parameter, and any changes to the parameter variable inside the method will not affect the original value within the caller. </p>
<p>Since value types require a memory copy, they generally should be defined to consume a small amount of memory (typically 16 bytes or less).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>DO NOT create value types that consume more than 16 bytes of memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Values of value types are often short-lived; often a value is only needed for a portion of an expression or for the activation of a method. In these cases, variables and temporary values of value types can often be stored on the temporary storage pool, often called “the stack.” (Though this is a misnomer; there is no requirement that the temporary pool allocates its storage off the stack, and in fact, as an implementation detail, it frequently chooses to allocate storage out of available registers instead.)</p>
<p>The temporary pool is less costly to clean up than the garbage-collected heap; however, value types tend to be copied more than reference types, and that copying can impose a performance cost of its own. Do not fall into the trap of believing that “value types are faster because they can be allocated on the stack.”</p>
<h3 id="Reference_Types">Reference Types</h3><p><strong>In contrast, the value of a reference type variable is a reference to an instance of an object (see Figure 8.2). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Variables of reference type store the reference (typically implemented as the memory address) where the data for the object instance is located, instead of storing the data directly, as a variable of value type does.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore, to access the data, the runtime will read the reference out of the variable and then dereference it to reach the location in memory that actually contains the data for the instance.</strong></p>

<p>A reference type variable, therefore, has two storage locations associated with it: the storage location directly associated with the variable, and the storage location referred to by the reference that is the value stored in the variable.</p>
<p>A reference type variable is, again, like a piece of paper that always has something written on it. </p>
<p>Imagine, for example, a piece of paper that has a house address written on it: say, “123 Sesame Street, New York City”. </p>
<p>The piece of paper is a variable; the address is a reference to a building. </p>
<p>Neither the paper nor the address written on it is the building, and the location of the paper need not have anything whatsoever to do with the location of the building its contents refer to. </p>
<p>If you make a copy of that reference on another piece of paper, the contents of both pieces of paper refer to the same building. </p>
<p>If you then paint that building green, the building referred to by both pieces of paper can be observed to be green, because the references refer to the same thing.</p>
<p>The storage location directly associated with the variable (or temporary value) is treated no differently than the storage location associated with a value type variable: If the variable is known to be short-lived it is allocated on the short-term storage pool. </p>
<p>The value of a reference type variable is always a reference to a storage location in the garbage-collected heap, or null.</p>
<p>Compared to a variable of value type, which stores the data of the instance directly, accessing the data associated with a reference involves an extra “hop”: First the reference must be dereferenced to find the storage location of the actual data, and then the data can be read or written. </p>
<p>Copying a reference type value only copies the reference, which is small. </p>
<p>(A reference is guaranteed to be no larger than the “bit size” of the processor; a 32-bit machine has 4-byte references, a 64-bit machine has 8-byte references, and so on.) Copying the value of a value type copies all the data, which could be large. </p>
<p>Therefore, there are circumstances in which reference types are more efficient to copy. </p>
<p>This is why the guideline for value types is to ensure that they are never more than 16 bytes or thereabouts; if a value type is more than four times as expensive to copy as a reference, it probably should simply be a reference type.</p>
<p>Since reference types copy only a reference to the data, two different variables can refer to the same data. </p>
<p>Thus, changing the data through one variable will be observed to change the data for the other variable as well. </p>
<p>This happens both for assignment and for method calls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To continue our previous analogy, if you pass the address of a building to a method, you make a copy of the paper containing the reference and hand the copy to the method. </p>
<p>The method cannot change the contents of the original paper to refer to a different building. </p>
<p>But if the method paints the referred-to building, when the method returns the caller can observe that the building the caller is still referring to is now a different color.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the C# “built-in” types, such as bool and decimal, are value types, with the exception of string and object, which are reference types. </p>
<p>Numerous additional value types are provided within the framework. It also is possible for developers to define their own value types.</p>
<p>To define a custom value type, you use a similar syntax as you would to define class and interface types. </p>
<p>The key difference in syntax is that value types use the keyword struct,</p>

<h3 id="IOC:">IOC:</h3><p>In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle in which custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. </p>
<p>A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.</p>
<p>Inversion of control is used to increase modularity of the program and make it extensible,[1] and has applications in object-oriented programming and other programming paradigms. </p>
<p>The term was popularized by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler.</p>
<p>The term is related to, but different from, the dependency inversion principle, which concerns itself with decoupling dependencies between high-level and low-level layers through shared abstractions.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>As an example, with traditional programming, the main function of an application might make function calls into a menu library to display a list of available commands and query the user to select one.[2] The library thus would return the chosen option as the value of the function call, and the main function uses this value to execute the associated command. This style was common in text based interfaces. For example, an email client may show a screen with commands to load new mails, answer the current mail, start a new mail, etc., and the program execution would block until the user presses a key to select a command.</p>
<p>With inversion of control, on the other hand, the program would be written using a software framework that knows common behavioral and graphical elements, such as windowing systems, menus, controlling the mouse, and so on. The custom code “fills in the blanks” for the framework, such as supplying a table of menu items and registering a code subroutine for each item, but it is the framework that monitors the user’s actions and invokes the subroutine when a menu item is selected. In the mail client example, the framework could follow both the keyboard and mouse inputs and call the command invoked by the user by either means, and at the same time monitor the network interface to find out if new messages arrive and refresh the screen when some network activity is detected. The same framework could be used as the skeleton for a spreadsheet program or a text editor. Conversely, the framework knows nothing about Web browsers, spreadsheets or text editors; implementing their functionality takes custom code.</p>
<p>Inversion of control carries the strong connotation that the reusable code and the problem-specific code are developed independently even though they operate together in an application. Software frameworks, callbacks, schedulers, event loops and dependency injection are examples of design patterns that follow the inversion of control principle, although the term is most commonly used in the context of object-oriented programming.</p>
<p><strong> Description </strong><br>In traditional programming, the flow of the business logic is determined by objects that are statically bound to one another. With inversion of control, the flow depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution. Such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions. This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator. In IoC, the code could also be linked statically during compilation, but finding the code to execute by reading its description from external configuration instead of with a direct reference in the code itself.</p>
<p>In dependency injection, a dependent object or module is coupled to the object it needs at run time. Which particular object will satisfy the dependency during program execution typically cannot be known at compile time using static analysis. While described in terms of object interaction here, the principle can apply to other programming methodologies besides object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>In order for the running program to bind objects to one another, the objects must possess compatible interfaces. For example, class A may delegate behavior to interface I which is implemented by class B; the program instantiates A and B, and then injects B into A.</p>
<p><strong> Benfits </strong><br>Inversion of control serves the following design purposes:</p>
<p><em>To decouple the execution of a task from implementation.
</em>To focus a module on the task it is designed for.<br><em>To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on contracts.
</em>To prevent side effects when replacing a module.</p>
<p>Inversion of control is sometimes facetiously referred to as the “Hollywood Principle: Don’t call us, we’ll call you”.</p>
<p><strong> How to implement </strong><br>In object-oriented programming, there are several basic techniques to implement inversion of control. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a factory pattern</li>
<li>Using a service locator pattern</li>
<li>Using a dependency injection, for example<ul>
<li>A constructor injection</li>
<li>A parameter injection</li>
<li>A setter injection</li>
<li>An interface injection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using a contextualized lookup</li>
<li>Using template method design pattern</li>
<li>Using strategy design pattern</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="DI">DI</h3><p>A dependency is an object that can be used (a service). An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it.</p>
<p>The service is made part of the client’s state. Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.</p>
<p>Dependency injection allows a program design to follow the dependency inversion principle.</p>
<p>The client delegates to external code (the injector) the responsibility of providing its dependencies. </p>
<p>The client is not allowed to call the injector code. </p>
<p>It is the injecting code that constructs the services and calls the client to inject them. </p>
<p>This means the client code does not need to know about the injecting code. </p>
<p>The client does not need to know how to construct the services. </p>
<p>The client does not need to know which actual services it is using.</p>
<p>The client only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how the client may use the services. This separates the responsibilities of use and construction.</p>
<p><strong> Taxonomy </strong></p>
<p>Inversion of Control (IoC) is more general than DI. </p>
<p>Put simply, IoC means letting other code call you rather than insisting on doing the calling. </p>
<p>An example of IoC without DI is the template pattern. Here polymorphism is achieved through subclassing, that is, inheritance.</p>
<p>Dependency injection implements IoC through composition so is often identical to that of the strategy pattern, but while the strategy pattern is intended for dependencies to be interchangeable throughout an object’s lifetime, in dependency injection it may be that only a single instance of a dependency is used. </p>
<p>This still achieves polymorphism, but through delegation and composition.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency injection allows a client the flexibility of being configurable. Only the client’s behavior is fixed. The client may act on anything that supports the intrinsic interface the client expects.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can be used to externalize a system’s configuration details into configuration files allowing the system to be reconfigured without recompilation. Separate configurations can be written for different situations that require different implementations of components. This includes, but is not limited to, testing.</li>
<li>Because dependency injection doesn’t require any change in code behavior it can be applied to legacy code as a refactoring. The result is clients that are more independent and that are easier to unit test in isolation using stubs or mock objects that simulate other objects not under test. This ease of testing is often the first benefit noticed when using dependency injection.</li>
<li>Dependency injection allows a client to remove all knowledge of a concrete implementation that it needs to use. This helps isolate the client from the impact of design changes and defects. It promotes reusability, testability and maintainability.</li>
<li>Reduction of boilerplate code in the application objects since all work to initialize or set up dependencies is handled by a provider component.</li>
<li>Dependency injection allows concurrent or independent development. Two developers can independently develop classes that use each other, while only needing to know the interface the classes will communicate through. Plugins are often developed by third party shops that never even talk to the developers who created the product that uses the plugins.</li>
<li>Dependency Injection decreases coupling between a class and its dependency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency injection creates clients that demand configuration details be supplied by construction code. This can be onerous when obvious defaults are available.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can make code difficult to trace (read) because it separates behavior from construction. This means developers must refer to more files to follow how a system performs.</li>
<li>Dependency injection typically requires more upfront development effort since one can not summon into being something right when and where it is needed but must ask that it be injected and then ensure that it is injected.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can cause an explosion of types, especially in languages that have explicit interface types, like Java and C#</li>
<li>Dependency injection forces complexity to move out of classes and into the linkages between classes which might not always be desirable or easily managed.</li>
<li>Ironically, dependency injection can encourage dependence on a dependency injection framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependency injection is a specific type of IoC using contextualized lookup.</p>
<h3 id="Interface_injection_comparison">Interface injection comparison</h3><p>The advantage of interface injection is that dependencies can be completely ignorant of their clients yet can still receive a reference to a new client and, using it, send a reference-to-self back to the client. In this way, the dependencies become injectors. The key is that the injecting method (which could just be a classic setter method) is provided through an interface.</p>
<p>An assembler is still needed to introduce the client and its dependencies. The assembler would take a reference to the client, cast it to the setter interface that sets that dependency, and pass it to that dependency object which would turn around and pass a reference-to-self back to the client.</p>
<p>For interface injection to have value, the dependency must do something in addition to simply passing back a reference to itself. This could be acting as a factory or sub-assembler to resolve other dependencies, thus abstracting some details from the main assembler. It could be reference-counting so that the dependency knows how many clients are using it. If the dependency maintains a collection of clients, it could later inject them all with a different instance of itself.</p>
<p>Interface injection:</p>
<p>This is simply the client publishing a role interface to the setter methods of the client’s dependencies. It can be used to establish how the injector should talk to the client when injecting dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="MVC">MVC</h2><p><strong> The ASP.NET MVC framework offers the following advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It makes it easier to manage complexity by dividing an application into the model, the<br>view, and the controller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It does not use view state or serverbased forms. This makes the MVC framework ideal<br>for developers who want full control over the behavior of an application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It uses a Front Controller pattern that processes Web application requests through a<br>single controller. This enables you to design an application that supports a rich routing<br>infrastructure. For more information, see Front Controller on the MSDN Web site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It provides better support for testdriven development (TDD).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It works well for Web applications that are supported by large teams of developers and<br>Web designers who need a high degree of control over the application behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What_is_Partial_View?_What_is_ChildAction,cant_be_call_directly,_generate_PartialView">What is Partial View? What is ChildAction,cant be call directly, generate PartialView</h3><p>Partial view is special view which renders a portion of view content. It is just like a user control web form application. Partial can be reusable in multiple views. It helps us to reduce code duplication. In other word a partial view enables us to render a view within the parent view.</p>
<p>@Html.Partial(“PartialViewExample”)  </p>
<p>@Html.RenderPartial(“PartialViewExample”)</p>
<p>ChildAction</p>
<p>The ChildActionOnly attribute ensures that an action method can be called only as a child method from within a view. An action method doesn’t need to have this attribute to be used as a child action, but we tend to use this attribute to prevent the action methods from being invoked as a result of a user request. Having defined an action method, we need to create what will be rendered when the action is invoked. Child actions are typically associated with partial views, although this is not compulsory.</p>
<p>[ChildActionOnly] allowing restricted access via code in View.</p>
<p>Phil Haack explains it nicely in this blog post. Basically a child action is a controller action that you could invoke from the view using the Html.Action helper:</p>
<p><code>@Html.Action(&quot;SomeActionName&quot;, &quot;SomeController&quot;)</code></p>
<p>This action will then execute and render its output at the specified location in the view. The difference with a Partial is that a partial only includes the specified markup, there’s no other action executing than the main action.</p>
<p>So you basically have the main action which received the request and rendered a view, but from within this view you could render multiple child actions which will go through their independent MVC lifecycle and eventually render the output. And all this will happen in the context of a single HTTP request.</p>
<p>Child actions are useful for creating entire reusable widgets which could be embedded into your views and which go through their independent MVC lifecycle.Child</p>

<p>For example, when the user clicks a link, a request is routed to the designated controller, and the corresponding action method is called.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to perform logic either before an action method is called or after an action method runs. </p>
<p>To support this, ASP.NET MVC provides filters. </p>
<p>Filters are custom classes that provide both a declarative and programmatic means to add pre-action and post-action behavior to controller action methods.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC Filter Types</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC supports the following types of action filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IAuthorizationFilter and make security decisions about whether to execute an action method, such as performing authentication or validating properties of the request. </p>
<p>The AuthorizeAttribute class and the RequireHttpsAttribute class are examples of an authorization filter. </p>
<p>Authorization filters run before any other filter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Action filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IActionFilter and wrap the action method execution. </p>
<p>The IActionFilter interface declares two methods: OnActionExecuting and OnActionExecuted. </p>
<p>OnActionExecuting runs before the action method. </p>
<p>OnActionExecuted runs after the action method and can perform additional processing, such as providing extra data to the action method, inspecting the return value, or canceling execution of the action method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Result filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IResultFilter and wrap execution of the ActionResult object. </p>
<p>IResultFilter declares two methods: OnResultExecuting and OnResultExecuted. </p>
<p>OnResultExecuting runs before the ActionResult object is executed. </p>
<p>OnResultExecuted runs after the result and can perform additional processing of the result, such as modifying the HTTP response. </p>
<p>The OutputCacheAttribute class is one example of a result filter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exception filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IExceptionFilter and execute if there is an unhandled exception thrown during the execution of the ASP.NET MVC pipeline. </p>
<p>Exception filters can be used for tasks such as logging or displaying an error page. </p>
<p>The HandleErrorAttribute class is one example of an exception filter.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Controller class implements each of the filter interfaces. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can implement any of the filters for a specific controller by overriding the controller’s On<filter> method. </filter></p>
<p>For example, you can override the OnAuthorization method. </p>
<p>The simple controller included in the downloadable sample overrides each of the filters and writes out diagnostic information when each filter runs. </p>
<p>You can implement the following On<filter> methods in a controller.</filter></p>
<p><code>[Authorize]</code><br><code>[OutputCache(Duration=10)]</code><br><code>[HandleError]</code><br><code>[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</code><br><code>[ValidateInput(false)]</code><br><code>[AllowAnonymous]</code><br><code>[HttpPost]</code><br><code>[HttpGet]</code></p>
<h2 id="SQL_Server">SQL Server</h2><h3 id="Index">Index</h3><p>A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and the use of more storage space to maintain the extra copy of data.</p>
<p>Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed.</p>
<p>Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table , providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records.</p>
<p>An index is a copy of select columns of data from a table that can be searched very efficiently that also includes a low level disk block address or direct link to the complete row of data it was copied from.</p>
<pre><code><span class="number">1.</span> With <span class="operator">a</span> clustered index <span class="operator">the</span> rows are stored physically <span class="command"><span class="keyword">on</span> <span class="title">the</span> <span class="title">disk</span> <span class="title">in</span> <span class="title">the</span> <span class="title">same</span> <span class="title">order</span> <span class="title">as</span> <span class="title">the</span> <span class="title">index</span>. </span>

There can therefore be only <span class="constant">one</span> clustered index.

<span class="number">2.</span> With <span class="operator">a</span> non clustered index there is <span class="operator">a</span> <span class="keyword">second</span> list that has pointers <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="operator">the</span> physical rows.

</code></pre><h3 id="Clustered">Clustered</h3><p>Clustering alters the data block into a certain distinct order to match the index, resulting in the row data being stored in order. Therefore, only one clustered index can be created on a given database table.</p>
<p>Clustered indices can greatly increase overall speed of retrieval, but usually only where the data is accessed sequentially in the same or reverse order of the clustered index, or when a range of items is selected.</p>
<p>Since the physical records are in this sort order on disk, the next row item in the sequence is immediately before or after the last one, and so fewer data block reads are required.</p>
<p>The primary feature of a clustered index is therefore the ordering of the physical data rows in accordance with the index blocks that point to them. Some databases separate the data and<br>index blocks into separate files, others put two completely different data blocks within the same physical file(s).</p>

<h2 id="GC">GC</h2><p>In computer science , garbage collection ( GC ) is a form of automatic memory management .<br>The garbage collector , or just collector , attempts to reclaim garbage , or memory occupied by<br>objects that are no longer in use by the program . Garbage collection was invented by John<br>McCarthy around 1959 to solve problems in Lisp.</p>
<p>Garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of manual memory management , which<br>requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory<br>system. However, many systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques<br>such as stack allocation and region inference . Like other memory management techniques,<br>garbage collection may take a significant proportion of total processing time in a program and<br>can thus have significant influence on performance.</p>
<p>Resources other than memory, such as network sockets , database handles , user interaction<br>windows, and file and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection.<br>Methods used to manage such resources, particularly destructors , may suffice to manage<br>memory as well, leaving no need for GC. Some GC systems allow such other resources to be<br>associated with a region of memory that, when collected, causes the other resource to be<br>reclaimed; this is called finalization . Finalization may introduce complications limiting its<br>usability, such as intolerable latency between disuse and reclaim of especially limited resources,<br>or a lack of control over which thread performs the work of reclaiming.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages">Advantages</h3><p>Garbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory deallocation. As a<br>result, certain categories of bugs are eliminated or substantially reduced:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dangling pointer bugs , which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are<br>still pointers to it, and one of those pointers is dereferenced. By then the memory<br>may have been reassigned to another use, with unpredictable results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double free bugs , which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory<br>that has already been freed, and perhaps already been allocated again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Certain kinds of memory leaks , in which a program fails to free memory occupied by<br>objects that have become unreachable , which can lead to memory exhaustion.<br>(Garbage collection typically does not deal with the unbounded accumulation of data<br>that is reachable, but that will actually not be used by the program.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Efficient implementations of persistent data structures<br>Some of the bugs addressed by garbage collection can have security implications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><p>Typically, garbage collection has certain disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Garbage collection consumes computing resources in deciding which memory to<br>free, even though the programmer may have already known this information. The<br>penalty for the convenience of not annotating object lifetime manually in the source<br>code is overhead , which can lead to decreased or uneven performance. Interaction<br>with memory hierarchy effects can make this overhead intolerable in circumstances<br>that are hard to predict or to detect in routine testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting<br>in stalls scattered throughout a session. Unpredictable stalls can be unacceptable in<br>realtime environments , in transaction processing , or in interactive programs.<br>Incremental, concurrent, and realtime garbage collectors address these problems, with varying tradeoffs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nondeterministic GC is incompatible with RAII based management of nonGCed<br>resources. As a result, the need for explicit manual resource management<br>(release/close) for nonGCed resources becomes transitive to composition. That is:<br>in a nondeterministic GC system, if a resource or a resourcelike<br>object requires manual resource management (release/close), and this object is used as ‘part of’<br>another object, then the composed object will also become a resourcelike<br>object that itself requires manual resource management (release/close).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="SOA">SOA</h2><p>A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology.</p>
<p>A service is a self-contained unit of functionality, such as retrieving an online bank statement. By that definition, a service is a discretely invokable operation. However, in the Web Services Definition Language (WSDL), a service is an interface definition that may list several discrete services/operations. And elsewhere, the term service is used for a component that is encapsulated behind an interface. This widespread ambiguity is reflected in what follows.</p>
<p>Services can be combined to provide the functionality of a large software application. SOA makes it easier for software components on computers connected over a network to cooperate. Every computer can run any number of services, and each service is built in a way that ensures that the service can exchange information with any other service in the network without human interaction and without the need to make changes to the underlying program itself.</p>
<h2 id="OO_Plinciple">OO Plinciple</h2><h3 id="Encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3><p>In a nutshell, encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors and mutators。</p>
<h3 id="Abstraction">Abstraction</h3><p>The best definition of abstraction I’ve ever read is: “An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of object and thus provide crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective of the viewer.” — G. Booch, Object-Oriented Design With Applications, Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, California, 1991.</p>
<p>Data abstraction is nothing more than the implementation of an object that contains the same essential properties and actions we can find in the original object we are representing.</p>
<h3 id="Inheritance">Inheritance</h3><p>“Is a” is the inheritance way of object relationship.</p>
<p>Rather than duplicate functionality, inheritance allows you to inherit functionality from another class, called a superclass or base class.</p>
<h3 id="Polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3><p>Polymorphism manifests itself by having multiple methods all with the same name, but slighty different functionality.</p>
<p>There are 2 basic types of polymorphism.<br>Overridding, also called run-time polymorphism, and overloading, which is referred to as compile-time polymorphism.  This difference is, for method overloading, the compiler determines which method will be executed, and this decision is made when the code gets compiled.<br>Which method will be used for method overriding is determined at runtime based on the dynamic type of an object.</p>
<h2 id="Reflection">Reflection</h2><p>In computer science, reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.</p>
<h3 id="Uses">Uses</h3><p>Reflection can be used for observing and modifying program execution at runtime. A reflection-oriented program component can monitor the execution of an enclosure of code and can modify itself according to a desired goal related to that enclosure. This is typically accomplished by dynamically assigning program code at runtime.</p>
<p>In object oriented programming languages such as Java, reflection allows inspection of classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime without knowing the names of the interfaces, fields, methods at compile time. It also allows instantiation of new objects and invocation of methods.</p>
<p>Reflection can also be used to adapt a given program to different situations dynamically. For example, consider an application that uses two different classes X and Y interchangeably to perform similar operations. Without reflection-oriented programming, the application might be hard-coded to call method names of class X and class Y. However, using the reflection-oriented programming paradigm, the application could be designed and written to utilize reflection in order to invoke methods in classes X and Y without hard-coding method names. Reflection-oriented programming almost always requires additional knowledge, framework, relational mapping, and object relevance in order to take advantage of more generic code execution.</p>
<p>Reflection is often used as part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.</p>
<p>Reflection is also a key strategy for metaprogramming.</p>
<p>In some object-oriented programming languages, such as C# and Java, reflection can be used to override member accessibility rules. For example, reflection makes it possible to change the value of a field marked “private” in a third-party library’s class.</p>

<h3 id="Benfits">Benfits</h3><p>1.<strong>Accommodate code generation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Partial methods allow generated code to call methods that have not necessarily been implemented. </li>
</ol>
<p>Even though the declarations of partial methods contain no implementation, this code will successfully compile.</p>
<ol>
<li>If there is no implementation provided for a partial method, no trace of the partial method appears in the CIL. This helps keep code size small while keeping flexibility high.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Limitation">Limitation</h3><ol>
<li><p><strong>Partial methods are allowed only within partial classes</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Partial methods must return void</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Similarly, <code>out</code> parameters are not allowed on partial methods. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If a return value is required, <code>ref</code> parameters may be used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Design_pattern">Design pattern</h2><h3 id="Singleton_Pattern">Singleton Pattern</h3><blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Benifits:-1">Benifits:</h4><blockquote>
<p>This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. </p>
<p>The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Implementation-1">Implementation</h4><blockquote>
<p>Implementation of a singleton pattern must satisfy the single instance and global access principles.</p>
<p>It requires a mechanism to access the singleton class member without creating a class object and a mechanism to persist the value of class members among class objects.</p>
<p>The singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one does not exist. </p>
<p>If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object. </p>
<p>To make sure that the object cannot be instantiated any other way, the constructor is made private. </p>
<p>Note the distinction between a simple static instance of a class and a singleton: although a singleton can be implemented as a static instance, it can also be lazily constructed, requiring no memory or resources until needed.</p>
<p>The singleton pattern must be carefully constructed in multi-threaded applications. </p>
<p>If two threads are to execute the creation method at the same time when a singleton does not yet exist, they both must check for an instance of the singleton and then only one should create the new one.</p>
<p>If the programming language has concurrent processing capabilities the method should be constructed to execute as a mutually exclusive operation. </p>
<p>The classic solution to this problem is to use mutual exclusion on the class that indicates that the object is being instantiated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Process_Thread">Process Thread</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing" target="_blank" rel="external">Process</a>)</p>
<p>In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. </p>
<p>It contains the program code and its current activity. </p>
<p>Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing" target="_blank" rel="external">Thread</a>)</p>
<p>In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.</p>
<p>The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. </p>
<p>Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently (one starting before others finish) and share resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. </p>
<p>In particular, the threads of a process share its instructions (executable code) and its context (the values of its variables at any given time).</p>
<h2 id="What_is_the_default_access_modif,ier_for_classes,_methods,_members,_constructors,_delegates_and_interfaces?">What is the default access modif,ier for classes, methods, members, constructors, delegates and interfaces?</h2><p>The default access for everything in C# is “the most restricted access you could declare for that member”.</p>
<p>So for example:</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">namespace</span> <span class="title">MyCompany</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Outer</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">Foo</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Inner</span> &#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">namespace</span> <span class="title">MyCompany</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">internal</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Outer</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">Foo</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Inner</span> &#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The one sort of exception to this is making one part of a property (usually the setter) more restricted than the declared accessibility of the property itself:</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> Name</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">get</span> &#123; ... &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">set</span> &#123; ... &#125; <span class="comment">// This isn't the default, have to do it explicitly</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This is what the C# 3.0 specification has to say (section 3.5.1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on the context in which a member declaration takes place, only certain types of declared accessibility are permitted. Furthermore, when a member declaration does not include any access modifiers, the context in which the declaration takes place determines the default declared accessibility.</p>
<p>Namespaces implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on namespace declarations.</p>
<p>Types declared in compilation units or namespaces can have public or internal declared accessibility and default to internal declared accessibility.</p>
<p>Class members can have any of the five kinds of declared accessibility and default to private declared accessibility. (Note that a type declared as a member of a class can have any of the five kinds of declared accessibility, whereas a type declared as a member of a namespace can have only public or internal declared accessibility.)</p>
<p>Struct members can have public, internal, or private declared accessibility and default to private declared accessibility because structs are implicitly sealed. Struct members introduced in a struct (that is, not inherited by that struct) cannot have protected or protected internal declared accessibility. (Note that a type declared as a member of a struct can have public, internal, or private declared accessibility, whereas a type declared as a member of a namespace can have only public or internal declared accessibility.)</p>
<p>Interface members implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on interface member declarations.</p>
<p>Enumeration members implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on enumeration member declarations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that nested types would come under the “class members” or “struct members” parts - and therefore default to private visibility.)</p>
<h3 id="Access_Modifiers">Access Modifiers</h3><p><strong>public</strong></p>
<p>The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.</p>
<p><strong>private</strong></p>
<p>The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.</p>
<p><strong>protected</strong></p>
<p>The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct, or in a class that is derived from that class.</p>
<p><strong>internal</strong></p>
<p>The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.</p>
<p><strong>protected internal</strong></p>
<p>The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly. Access from another assembly must take place within a class declaration that derives from the class in which the protected internal element is declared, and it must take place through an instance of the derived class type.</p>
<h2 id="Structs">Structs</h2><p>*What is the keyword to define custom type?<br>“Struct”</p>
<p>Structs share most of the same syntax as classes, although structs are more limited than classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within a struct declaration, fields cannot be initialized unless they are declared as const or static.</li>
<li>A struct cannot declare a default constructor (a constructor without parameters) or a destructor.</li>
<li>Structs are copied on assignment. When a struct is assigned to a new variable, all the data is copied, and any modification to the new copy does not change the data for the original copy. This is important to remember when working with collections of value types such as Dictionary<string, mystruct="">.</string,></li>
<li>Structs are value types and classes are reference types.</li>
<li>Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using a new operator.</li>
<li>Structs can declare constructors that have parameters.</li>
<li>A struct cannot inherit from another struct or class, and it cannot be the base of a class. All structs inherit directly from System.ValueType, which inherits from System.Object.</li>
<li>A struct can implement interfaces.</li>
<li>A struct can be used as a nullable type and can be assigned a null value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="LINQ">LINQ</h2><p>Rather than add relational or XML-specific features to our programming languages and runtime, with the LINQ project we have taken</p>
<p><strong> a more general approach and are adding general-purpose query facilities to the .NET Framework that apply to all sources of information, not just relational or XML data. </strong></p>
<p>This facility is called .NET Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).</p>
<h3 id="Benfits-1">Benfits</h3><p>We use the term language-integrated query to indicate that </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Query is an integrated feature of the developer’s primary programming languages (for example, Visual C#, Visual Basic).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Language-integrated query allows query expressions to benefit from the rich metadata,</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile-time syntax checking,</p>
</li>
<li><p>static typing </p>
</li>
<li><p>IntelliSense that was previously available only to imperative code. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Language-integrated query also allows a single general purpose declarative query facility to be applied to all in-memory information, not just information from external sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Implementation-2">Implementation</h3><p>.NET Language-Integrated Query defines a set of general purpose standard query operators that allow traversal, filter, and projection operations to be expressed in a direct yet declarative way in any .NET-based programming language.</p>
<p>The standard query operators allow queries to be applied to any IEnumerable<t>-based information source.</t></p>
<p>LINQ allows third parties to augment the set of standard query operators with new domain-specific operators that are appropriate for the target domain or technology.</p>
<p>More importantly, third parties are also free to replace the standard query operators with their own implementations that provide additional services such as remote evaluation, query translation, optimization, and so on. </p>
<p>By adhering to the conventions of the LINQ pattern, such implementations enjoy the same language integration and tool support as the standard query operators.</p>
<p>The extensibility of the query architecture is used in the LINQ project itself to provide implementations that work over both XML and SQL data. </p>
<p>The query operators over XML (LINQ to XML) use an efficient, easy-to-use, in-memory XML facility to provide XPath/XQuery functionality in the host programming language.</p>
<p>The query operators over relational data (LINQ to SQL) build on the integration of SQL-based schema definitions into the common language runtime (CLR) type system. </p>
<p>This integration provides strong typing over relational data while retaining the expressive power of the relational model and the performance of query evaluation directly in the underlying store.</p>

<p>A semaphore with a capacity of one is similar to a Mutex or lock, except that the semaphore has no “owner” — it’s thread-agnostic. </p>
<p>Any thread can call Release on a Semaphore, whereas with Mutex and lock, only the thread that obtained the lock can release it.</p>
<p>*CLR handle multi catch </p>
<p>*Abstract class vs Interface.</p>
<p>Enum -<br><code>System.Enum</code> is a reference type, but any specific enum type is a value type. </p>
<p>In the same way, <code>System.ValueType</code> is a reference type, but all types inheriting from it (other than System.Enum) are value types.</p>
<p>So if you have an enum <code>Foo</code> and you want a <strong>nullable</strong> property, you need the property type to be <code>Foo?</code>.</p>

<h3 id="HTML_Questions:">HTML Questions:</h3><h4 id="What_does_a_doctype_do?">What does a <code>doctype</code> do?</h4><p>It’s an integral part of HTML as defined in the specification:</p>
<p>A DOCTYPE is a required preamble.</p>
<p>DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications.</p>

<h4 id="What’s_the_difference_between_standards_mode_and_quirks_mode?">What’s the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?</h4><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode" target="_blank" rel="external">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode</a><br><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html</a></p>
<p>The two ’modes’ modern browsers can use to interpret your CSS.</p>
<p>In the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two versions: One for Netscape Navigator, and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer. When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.</p>
<p>There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode. In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. In full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. In almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.</p>
<p><strong>How do browsers determine which mode to use?</strong></p>
<p>For HTML documents, browsers use a DOCTYPE in the beginning of the document to decide whether to handle it in quirks mode or standards mode. To ensure that your page uses full standards mode, make sure that your page has a DOCTYPE </p>
<p>The DOCTYPE shown in the example, &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, is the simplest possible, and the one recommended by HTML5. Earlier versions of the HTML standard recommended other variants, but all existing browsers today will use full standards mode for this DOCTYPE, even the dated Internet Explorer 6. There are no valid reasons to use a more complicated DOCTYPE. If you do use another DOCTYPE, you may risk choosing one which triggers almost standards mode or quirks mode.</p>
<p>Make sure you put the DOCTYPE right at the beginning of your HTML document. Anything before the DOCTYPE, like a comment or an XML declaration will trigger quirks mode in Internet Explorer 9 and older.</p>
<p>In HTML5, the only purpose of the DOCTYPE is to activate full standards mode. Older versions of the HTML standard gave additional meaning to the DOCTYPE, but no browser has ever used the DOCTYPE for anything other than switching between quirks mode and standards mode.</p>
<p><strong>XHTML</strong></p>
<p>If you serve your page as XHTML using the application/xhtml+xml MIME type in the Content-Type HTTP header, you do not need a DOCTYPE to enable standards mode, as such documents always use full standards mode. Note however that serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml will cause Internet Explorer 8 to show a download dialog box for an unknown format instead of displaying your page, as the first version of Internet Explorer with support for XHTML is Internet Explorer 9.</p>
<p>If you serve XHTML-like content using the text/html MIME type, browsers will read it as HTML, and you will need the DOCTYPE to use standards mode.</p>
<p><strong>How do I see which mode is used?</strong></p>
<p>In Firefox, select View Page Info from the context menu, and look for Render Mode.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, press F12, and look for Document Mode.</p>
<h4 id="What’s_the_difference_between_HTML_and_XHTML?">What’s the difference between HTML and XHTML?</h4><p>XHTML is the XML version of HTML.</p>
<p>To understand this answer you have to know what XML is : it’s a markup language designed to format data in a way that’s easy to understand for a human, and also easy to parse for a machine.</p>
<p>XML is also a meta-language. This means that a lot of languages are based on XML, with rules and grammar defined to make a language with specific purpose from XML. Some well-known  examples are OpenMath, MML, XPath, XQuery, …</p>
<p>Now at the beginning of the web, the markup language that was used for web pages was HTML. It looks a lot like XML but it’s not an XML language because it does not respect the XML standard.</p>
<p>Later, XHTML was invented with respect to the XML standard. It is more strict than html because you have to respect all the xml rules (Closing tag for each opening tag, attributes have to have a value etc.)</p>
<p>So the short answer is : xHTML is XML, HTML is not.</p>
<p>XHTML is not so much different from HTML 4.01 standard. The major differences are:</p>
<p><strong>Document Structure</strong><br><em>XHTML DOCTYPE is mandatory
</em>The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory<br><em><html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory<br><strong>XHTML Elements</strong>
</body></title></head></html></em>XHTML elements must be properly nested<br><em>XHTML elements must always be closed
</em>XHTML elements must be in lowercase<br><em>XHTML documents must have one root element<br><strong>XHTML Attributes</strong>
</em>Attribute names must be in lower case<br><em>Attribute values must be quoted
</em>Attribute minimization is forbidden</html></p>
<p>Basically, XHTML is HTML (all the html tags are found in XHTML) that follows the rules of XML (because it is a family of XML).</p>
<h4 id="Are_there_any_problems_with_serving_pages_as_application/xhtml+xml?">Are there any problems with serving pages as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>?</h4><p>When you’re coding XHTML, you should deliver it as application/xhtml+xml. The problem is however, that once you do that, IE 6 &amp; 7 break horribly… For your pages to render properly in those browsers, you’d need to set the mime type to text/html. Some very bright people have thought this problem in the past and came up with a real good solution in PHP, which you can find here: serving up XHTML with the correct MIME type.</p>
<p>WordPress though is always served as XHTML, so if possible, it should send the proper MIME type. I wrote a small plugin that does that: XHTML MIME type plugin. It doesn’t work on this blog yet because of some modifications I’ve done, but I’ll try to get it working.</p>
<p>I use content negotiation to switch between application/xhtml+xml and text/html just like you describe, without noticing any problems with search bots. Strictly though, you should take into account the q values in the accept header that indicates the preference of the user agent to each content type. If a user agent prefers to accept text/html but will accept application/xhtml+xml as an alternate, then for greatest safety you should have the page served as text/html.</p>
<p>One problem with content negotiation (and with serving different content/headers to different user-agents) is proxy servers. Considering the following; I ran into this back in the Netscape 4 days and have been shy of server side sniffing ever since.</p>
<p>User A downloads your page with Firefox, and gets a XHTML/XML Content-Type. The user’s ISP has a proxy server between the user and your site, so this page is now cached.</p>
<p>User B, same ISP, requests your page using Internet Explorer. The request hits the proxy first, the proxy says “hey, I have that page, here it is; as application/xhtml+xml”. User B is prompted to download the file (as IE will download anything sent as application/xhtml+xml.</p>
<p>You can get around this particular issue by using the Vary Header, as described in this 456 Berea Street article. I also assume that proxy servers have gotten a bit smarter about auto detecting these things.</p>
<p>Here’s where the CF that is HTML/XHTML starts to creep in. When you use content negotiation to serve application/xhtml+xml to one set of user-agents, and text/html to another set of user agents, you’re relying on all the proxies between your server and your users to be well behaved.</p>
<p>Even if all the proxy servers in the world were smart enough to recognize the Vary header (they aren’t) you still have to contend with the computer janitors of the world. There are a lot of smart, talented, and dedicated IT professionals in the world. There are more not so smart people who spend their days double clicking installer applications and thinking “The Internet” is that blue E in their menu. A mis-configured proxy could still improperly cache pages and headers, leaving you out of luck.</p>

<h4 id="What_are_data-_attributes_good_for?">What are <code>data-</code> attributes good for?</h4><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes" target="_blank" rel="external">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes</a></p>
<p>HTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as classList, non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or setUserData.</p>
<p>HTML Syntax<br>The syntax is simple. Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute. Say you have an article and you want to store some extra information that doesn’t have any visual representation. Just use data attributes for that:</p>
<article id="electriccars" data-columns="3" data-index-number="12314" data-parent="cars"><br>…<br></article>

<p>JavaScript Access</p>
<p>Reading the values of these attributes out in JavaScript is also very simple. You could use getAttribute() with their full HTML name to read them, but the standard defines a simpler way: a DOMStringMap you can read out via a dataset property.</p>
<p>To get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note that dashes are converted to camelCase).</p>
<p>var article = document.getElementById(‘electriccars’);</p>
<p>article.dataset.columns // “3”<br>article.dataset.indexNumber // “12314”<br>article.dataset.parent // “cars”<br>Each property is a string and can be read and written. In the above case setting article.dataset.columns = 5 would change that attribute to “5”.</p>
<p>CSS Access<br>Note that, as data attributes are plain HTML attributes, you can even access them from CSS. For example to show the parent data on the article you can use generated content in CSS with the attr() function:</p>
<p>article::before {<br>  content: attr(data-parent);<br>}<br>You can also use the attribute selectors in CSS to change styles according to the data:</p>
<p>article[data-columns=’3’] {<br>  width: 400px;<br>}<br>article[data-columns=’4’] {<br>  width: 600px;<br>}<br>You can see all this working together. </p>
<p>Data attributes can also be stored to contain information that is constantly changing, like scores in a game. Using the CSS selectors and JavaScript access here this allows you to build some nifty effects without having to write your own display routines. See this screencast for an example using generated content and CSS transitions (JSBin example).</p>
<p>Since data values are strings, all values must have quotes or else the styling won’t have any effect.</p>
<h4 id="Consider_HTML5_as_an_open_web_platform-_What_are_the_building_blocks_of_HTML5?">Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?</h4><h4 id="Describe_the_difference_between_a_cookie,_sessionStorage_and_localStorage-">Describe the difference between a <code>cookie</code>, <code>sessionStorage</code> and <code>localStorage</code>.</h4><p>localStorage and sessionStorage are both so-called WebStorages and features of HTML5.</p>
<p>localStorage stores information as long as the user does not delete them.</p>
<p>sessionStorage stores information as long as the session goes. Usually until the user closes the tab/browser.</p>
<p>cookies are simply cookies, which are supported by older browsers and usually are a fallback for frameworks that use the above mentioned WebStorages.</p>
<p>In contrast cookies can store way less information then WebStorages and the information in WebStorages is never transferred to the server.</p>
<p>This is an extremely broad scope question, and a lot of the pros/cons will be contextual to the situation.</p>
<p>In all cases these storage mechanisms will be specific to an individual browser on an individual computer/device. Any requirement to store data on an ongoing basis across sessions will need to involve your application server side - most likely using a database, but possibly XML or a text/CSV file.</p>
<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all client storage solutions. Session data is held on the server where it remains under your direct control.</p>
<p>localStorage and sessionStorage<br>localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name persists) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the window is closed) - it does however survive page reloads (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network).</p>
<p>Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.</p>
<p>localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security related data within applications.</p>
<p>Cookies<br>This is also true for cookies, these can be trivially tampered with by the user, and data can also be read from them in plain text - so if you are wanting to store sensitive data then session is really your only option. If you are not using SSL, cookie information can also be intercepted in transit, especially on an open wifi.</p>
<p>On the positive side cookies can have a degree of protection applied from security risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)/Script injection by setting an HTTP only flag which means modern (supporting) browsers will prevent access to the cookies and values from JavaScript (this will also prevent your own, legitimate, JavaScript from accessing them). This is especially important with authentication cookies, which are used to store a token containing details of the user who is logged on - if you have a copy of that cookie then for all intents and purposes you become that user as far as the web application is concerned, and have the same access to data and functionality the user has.</p>
<p>As cookies are used for authentication purposes and persistence of user data, all cookies valid for a page are sent from the browser to the server for every request to the same domain - this includes the original page request, any subsequent Ajax requests, all images, stylesheets, scripts and fonts. For this reason cookies should not be used to store large amounts of information. Browser may also impose limits on the size of information that can be stored in cookies. Typically cookies are used to store identifying tokens for authentication, session and advertising tracking. The tokens are typically not human readable information in and of themselves, but encrypted identifiers linked to your application or database.</p>
<p>localStorage vs. sessionStorage vs. Cookies<br>In terms of capabilities, cookies only allow you to store strings. sessionStorage and localStorage allow you to store JavaScript primitives but not Objects or Arrays (it is possible to JSON serialise them to store them using the APIs). Session storage will generally allow you to store any primitives or objects supported by your Server Side language/framework.</p>
<p>Client-side vs. Server-side<br>As HTTP is a stateless protocol - web applications have no way of identifying a user from previous visits on returning to the web site - session data usually relies on a cookie token to identify the user for repeat visits (although rarely URL parameters may be used for the same purpose). Data will usually have a sliding expiry time (renewed each time the user visits), and depending on your server/framework data will either be stored in-process (meaning data will be lost if the web server crashes or is restarted) or externally in a state server or database. This is also necessary when using a web-farm (more than one server for a given website).</p>
<p>As session data is completely controlled by your application (server side) it is the best place for anything sensitive or secure in nature.</p>
<p>The obvious disadvantage with server side data is scalability - server resources are required for each user for the duration of the session, and that any data needed client side must be sent with each request. As the server has no way of knowing if a user navigates to another site or closes their browser, session data must expire after a given time to avoid all server resources being taken up by abandoned sessions. When using session data you should therefore be aware of the possibility that data will have expired and been lost, especially on pages with long forms. It will also be lost if the user deletes their cookies or switches browsers/devices.</p>
<p>Some web frameworks/developers use hidden HTML inputs to persist data from one page of a form to another to avoid session expiration.</p>
<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all subject to “same-origin” rules which means browsers should prevent access to the data except from the domain that set the information to start with.</p>
<h4 id="Describe_the_difference_between_\,_\_and_\-">Describe the difference between \<script\>, \<script async \=""> and \<script defer\>.</h4><p><a href="http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html">http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html</a></p>
<p>\<script\><br>Let’s start by defining what \<script\> without any attributes does. The HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it’s external). The script will then be executed before parsing is resumed.</p>
<p>\<script async="" \><br>async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.</p>
<p>\<script defer\><br>defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. defer scripts are also guarenteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.</p>
<p>When should I use what?<br>Typically you want to use async where possible, then defer then no attribute. Here are some general rules to follow:<br>If the script is modular and does not rely on any scripts then use async.<br>If the script relies upon or is relied upon by another script then use defer.<br>If the script is small and is relied upon by an async script then use an inline script with no attributes placed above the async scripts.</p>
<h4 id="Why_is_it_generally_a_good_idea_to_position_CSS_&lt;link&gt;s_between_&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;_and_JS_\&lt;script\&gt;s_just_before_&lt;/body&gt;?_Do_you_know_any_exceptions?">Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>s between <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> and JS <code>\&lt;script\&gt;</code>s just before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>? Do you know any exceptions?</h4><p>The reasoning for <link> at the top is browsers have to reflow the layout as CSS files load (if they’re not in the <head>) moving elements around while the user is trying to interact with the page. For \<script\> files at the end, browsers have to (in most cases) block processing the HTML while a JavaScript file is loaded and run in case it makes in Write() calls (which you’re not supposed to do anymore these days); if the \<script\> tag is at the end, the browser can still display all of the HTML above the \<script\> tags while it is processing the JavaScript. </p>
<p>Just to add on to what jdelStrother has mentioned about w3 specs and ARTstudio about browser rendering.</p>
<p>It is recommended because when you have the CSS declared before <body> starts, your styles has actually loaded already. So very quickly users see something appear on their screen (e.g. background colors). If not, users see blank screen for some time before the CSS reaches the user.</p>
<p>Also, if you leave the the styles somewhere in the <body>, the browser has to re-render the page (new and old when loading) when the styles declared has been parsed.</p>

Bubbling events will then trigger any additional event listeners found by following the EventTarget&#39;s parent chain upward, checking for any event listeners registered on each successive EventTarget. This upward propagation will continue up to and including the Document.&#10;Event bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in browsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn). This is event delegation. Here&#39;s an example of it in practice:&#10;&#10;&#60;ul onclick=&#34;alert(event.type + &#39;!&#39;)&#34;&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;One&#60;/li&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;Two&#60;/li&#62;&#10;    &#60;li&#62;Three&#60;/li&#62;&#10;&#60;/ul&#62;&#10;With that example if you were to click on any of the child &#60;li&#62; nodes, you would see an alert of &#34;click!&#34;, even though there is no click handler bound to the &#60;li&#62; you clicked on. If we bound onclick=&#34;...&#34; to each &#60;li&#62; you would get the same effect.&#10;&#10;So what&#39;s the benefit?&#10;&#10;Imagine you now have a need to dynamically add new &#60;li&#62; items to the above list via DOM manipulation:&#10;&#10;var newLi = document.createElement(&#39;li&#39;);&#10;newLi.innerHTML = &#39;Four&#39;;&#10;myUL.appendChild(newLi);&#10;Without using event delegation you would have to &#34;rebind&#34; the &#34;onclick&#34; event handler to the new &#60;li&#62; element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. With event delegation you don&#39;t need to do anything. Just add the new &#60;li&#62; to the list and you&#39;re done.&#10;&#10;This is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound to many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or removed in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings can be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, and code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be decoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.&#10;&#10;Another benefit to event delegation is that the total memory footprint used by event listeners goes down (since the number of event bindings go down). It may not make much of a difference to small pages that unload often (i.e. user&#39;s navigate to different pages often). But for long-lived applications it can be significant. There are some really difficult-to-track-down situations when elements removed from the DOM still claim memory (i.e. they leak), and often this leaked memory is tied to an event binding. With event delegation you&#39;re free to destroy child elements without risk of forgetting to &#34;unbind&#34; their event listeners (since the listener is on the ancestor). These types of memory leaks can then be contained (if not eliminated, which is freaking hard to do sometimes. IE I&#39;m looking at you).&#10;&#10;Here are some better concrete code examples of event delegation:&#10;&#10;How JavaScript Event Delegation Works&#10;&#10;https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate&#10;&#10;Event Delegation versus Event Handling&#10;jQuery.delegate is event delegation + selector specification&#10;jQuery.on uses event delegation when passed a selector as the 2nd parameter&#10;Event delegation without a JavaScript library&#10;Closures vs Event delegation: takes a look at the pros of not converting code to use event delegation&#10;Interesting approach PPK uncovered for delegating the focus and blur events (which do not bubble)&#10;&#10;&#10;#### Explain how `this` works in JavaScript&#10;&#10;http://davidshariff.com/blog/javascript-this-keyword/&#10;&#10;JavaScript&#8217;s &#8216;this&#8217; Keyword&#10;&#10;A commonly used feature of JavaScript is the &#8220;this&#8221; keyword, but it is often also one of the most confused and misinterpreted features of the language. What does &#8220;this&#8221; actually mean and how is it decided?&#10;&#10;This article tries to clear up the confusion and explain the answer in a clear fashion.&#10;&#10;The &#8220;this&#8221; keyword is not new to those who have programmed in other languages, and more often than not it refers to the new object created when instantiating a class via it&#8217;s constructor. For example, if I have a class Boat(), which has a method moveBoat(), when refering to &#8220;this&#8221; inside of the moveBoat() method, we are actually accessing the newly created object of Boat().&#10;&#10;In JavaScript, we also have this concept inside a Function constructor when it is invoked using the &#8220;new&#8221; keyword, however it is not the only rule and &#8220;this&#8221; can often refer to a different object from a different execution context. If you are not familiar with JavaScript&#8217;s execution context, I recommend you read my other post on the topic here. Enough talking, let&#8217;s see some JavaScript examples:&#10;&#10;```javascript&#10;// global scope&#10;&#10;foo = &#39;abc&#39;;&#10;alert(foo); // abc&#10;&#10;this.foo = &#39;def&#39;;&#10;alert(foo); // def</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you use the keyword “this” in the global context (not inside a function), it always refers to the global object. Now let’s look at the value of “this” inside a function:</p>

<p>You probably don’t often purposefully define a variable to null, but it may be the return value of a function. Often you’ll need to gaurd against null values in your code.</p>
<p>You can know if a variable is null with the following:</p>
