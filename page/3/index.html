          <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Reflection can be used for observing and modifying program execution at runtime. </p>
<p>A reflection-oriented program component can monitor the execution of an enclosure of code and can modify itself according to a desired goal related to that enclosure. </p>
<p>This is typically accomplished by dynamically assigning program code at runtime.</p>
<p>In object oriented programming languages such as Java, reflection allows inspection of classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime without knowing the names of the interfaces, fields, methods at compile time. </p>
<p>It also allows instantiation of new objects and invocation of methods.</p>
<p>Reflection can also be used to adapt a given program to different situations dynamically.</p>
<p>For example, consider an application that uses two different classes X and Y interchangeably to perform similar operations.</p>
<p>Without reflection-oriented programming, the application might be hard-coded to call method names of class X and class Y. </p>
<p>However, using the reflection-oriented programming paradigm, the application could be designed and written to utilize reflection in order to invoke methods in classes X and Y without hard-coding method names. </p>
<p>Reflection-oriented programming almost always requires additional knowledge, framework, relational mapping, and object relevance in order to take advantage of more generic code execution.</p>
<p>Reflection is often used as part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.</p>
<p>Reflection is also a key strategy for metaprogramming.</p>
<p>In some object-oriented programming languages, such as C# and Java, reflection can be used to override member accessibility rules. </p>
<p>For example, reflection makes it possible to change the value of a field marked “private” in a third-party library’s class.</p>
<h4 id="Implementation">Implementation</h4><p>A language supporting reflection provides a number of features available at runtime that would otherwise be difficult to accomplish in a lower-level language. </p>
<p>Some of these features are the abilities to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discover and modify source code constructions (such as code blocks, classes, methods, protocols, etc.) as a first-class object at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Convert a string matching the symbolic name of a class or function into a reference to or invocation of that class or function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluate a string as if it were a source code statement at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new interpreter for the language’s bytecode to give a new meaning or purpose for a programming construct.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These features can be implemented in different ways.</p>
<p>In MOO, reflection forms a natural part of everyday programming idiom. </p>
<p>When verbs (methods) are called, various variables such as verb (the name of the verb being called) and this (the object on which the verb is called) are populated to give the context of the call.</p>
<p>Security is typically managed by accessing the caller stack programmatically:</p>
<p>Since callers() is a list of the methods by which the current verb was eventually called, performing tests on callers()[1] (the command invoked by the original user) allows the verb to protect itself against unauthorised use.</p>
<p>Compiled languages rely on their runtime system to provide information about the source code. </p>
<p>A compiled Objective-C executable, for example, records the names of all methods in a block of the executable, providing a table to correspond these with the underlying methods (or selectors for these methods) compiled into the program. </p>
<p>In a compiled language that supports runtime creation of functions, such as Common Lisp, the runtime environment must include a compiler or an interpreter.</p>
<p>Reflection can be implemented for languages not having built-in reflection facilities by using a program transformation system to define automated source code changes.</p>

<p>The derived type, Contact, is a PdaItem and can be assigned directly to a variable of type PdaItem. </p>
<p>This is known as an <strong>implicit conversion</strong> because no cast operator is required and the conversion will, on principle, always succeed; it will not throw an exception.</p>
<p>The reverse, however, is not true. </p>
<p>A PdaItem is not necessarily a Contact; it could be an Appointment or some other derived type. </p>
<p>Therefore, casting from the base type to the derived type requires an <strong>explicit cast</strong>, which at runtime could fail. </p>
<p>To perform an explicit cast, identify the target type within parentheses prior to the original reference.</p>
<p>An implicit conversion to a base class <strong>does not instantiate a new instance</strong>. </p>
<p>Instead, the same instance is <strong>simply referred to as the base type</strong> and the capabilities (the accessible members) are those of the base type.</p>
<p>Similarly, casting down from the base class to the derived class simply begins referring to the type more specifically, expanding the available operations. </p>
<p>The restriction is that the actual instantiated type must be an instance of the targeted type (or something derived from it).</p>

<p>A subtlety shown in the Contact.Load() method is worth noting. Developers are often surprised that from code within Contact it is not possible to access the protected ObjectKey of an explicit PdaItem, even though Contact derives from PdaItem. The reason is that a PdaItem could potentially be an Address, and Contact should not be able to access protected members of Address. Therefore, encapsulation prevents Contact from potentially modifying the ObjectKey of an Address. A successful cast to Contact will bypass the restriction as shown. The governing rule is that accessing a protected member from a derived class requires compile-time determination that the protected member is an instance of the derived class (or a class further derived from it).</p>

<p><strong>The variable name is associated directly with the storage location in memory where the value is stored.</strong></p>
<p>Because of this, when a second variable is assigned the value of an original variable, a copy of the original variable’s value is made to the storage location associated with the second variable.</p>
<p>Two variables never refer to the same storage location (unless one or both are an out or ref parameter, which are, by definition, aliases for another variable). </p>
<p>So, changing the value of the original variable will not affect the value in the second variable, since each variable is associated with a different storage location. </p>
<p>Consequently, changing the value of one value type variable cannot affect the value of any other value type variable.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/08fig01.jpg" alt="ValueTypes"></p>
<p>A value type variable is like a piece of paper that has a number written on it. </p>
<p>If you want to change the number, you can erase it and replace it with a different number. </p>
<p>If you have a second piece of paper, you can copy the number from the first piece of paper, but the two pieces of paper are then independent; erasing and replacing the number on one of them does not change the other.</p>
<p>Similarly, passing an instance of a value type to a method such as Console.WriteLine() will also result in a memory copy from the storage location associated with the argument to the storage location associated with the parameter, and any changes to the parameter variable inside the method will not affect the original value within the caller. </p>
<p>Since value types require a memory copy, they generally should be defined to consume a small amount of memory (typically 16 bytes or less).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>DO NOT create value types that consume more than 16 bytes of memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Values of value types are often short-lived; often a value is only needed for a portion of an expression or for the activation of a method. In these cases, variables and temporary values of value types can often be stored on the temporary storage pool, often called “the stack.” (Though this is a misnomer; there is no requirement that the temporary pool allocates its storage off the stack, and in fact, as an implementation detail, it frequently chooses to allocate storage out of available registers instead.)</p>
<p>The temporary pool is less costly to clean up than the garbage-collected heap; however, value types tend to be copied more than reference types, and that copying can impose a performance cost of its own. Do not fall into the trap of believing that “value types are faster because they can be allocated on the stack.”</p>
<h3 id="Reference_Types_-_class,_interface_,delegate,_array_type-">Reference Types - class, interface ,delegate, array type.</h3><p><strong>In contrast, the value of a reference type variable is a reference to an instance of an object (see Figure 8.2). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Variables of reference type store the reference (typically implemented as the memory address) where the data for the object instance is located, instead of storing the data directly, as a variable of value type does.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore, to access the data, the runtime will read the reference out of the variable and then dereference it to reach the location in memory that actually contains the data for the instance.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/gallery/08fig02.jpg" alt="ReferenceTypes"></p>
<p>A reference type variable, therefore, has two storage locations associated with it: the storage location directly associated with the variable, and the storage location referred to by the reference that is the value stored in the variable.</p>
<p>A reference type variable is, again, like a piece of paper that always has something written on it. </p>
<p>Imagine, for example, a piece of paper that has a house address written on it: say, “123 Sesame Street, New York City”. </p>
<p>The piece of paper is a variable; the address is a reference to a building. </p>
<p>Neither the paper nor the address written on it is the building, and the location of the paper need not have anything whatsoever to do with the location of the building its contents refer to. </p>
<p>If you make a copy of that reference on another piece of paper, the contents of both pieces of paper refer to the same building. </p>
<p>If you then paint that building green, the building referred to by both pieces of paper can be observed to be green, because the references refer to the same thing.</p>
<p>The storage location directly associated with the variable (or temporary value) is treated no differently than the storage location associated with a value type variable: If the variable is known to be short-lived it is allocated on the short-term storage pool. </p>
<p>The value of a reference type variable is always a reference to a storage location in the garbage-collected heap, or null.</p>
<p>Compared to a variable of value type, which stores the data of the instance directly, accessing the data associated with a reference involves an extra “hop”: First the reference must be dereferenced to find the storage location of the actual data, and then the data can be read or written. </p>
<p>Copying a reference type value only copies the reference, which is small. </p>
<p>(A reference is guaranteed to be no larger than the “bit size” of the processor; a 32-bit machine has 4-byte references, a 64-bit machine has 8-byte references, and so on.) Copying the value of a value type copies all the data, which could be large. </p>
<p>Therefore, there are circumstances in which reference types are more efficient to copy. </p>
<p>This is why the guideline for value types is to ensure that they are never more than 16 bytes or thereabouts; if a value type is more than four times as expensive to copy as a reference, it probably should simply be a reference type.</p>
<p>Since reference types copy only a reference to the data, two different variables can refer to the same data. </p>
<p>Thus, changing the data through one variable will be observed to change the data for the other variable as well. </p>
<p>This happens both for assignment and for method calls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To continue our previous analogy, if you pass the address of a building to a method, you make a copy of the paper containing the reference and hand the copy to the method. </p>
<p>The method cannot change the contents of the original paper to refer to a different building. </p>
<p>But if the method paints the referred-to building, when the method returns the caller can observe that the building the caller is still referring to is now a different color.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the C# “built-in” types, such as bool and decimal, are value types, with the exception of string and object, which are reference types. </p>
<p>Numerous additional value types are provided within the framework. It also is possible for developers to define their own value types.</p>
<p>To define a custom value type, you use a similar syntax as you would to define class and interface types. </p>
<p>The key difference in syntax is that value types use the keyword struct,</p>
<h2 id="Abstract_class_vs_Interface-">Abstract class vs Interface.</h2><h3 id="Abstract_Class">Abstract Class</h3><p>Abstract is a class contains anything classes can have plus abstract methods which are signature for methods need to be implemented.</p>
<p>An abstract class is a special kind of class that cannot be instantiated. So the question is why we need a class that cannot be instantiated? An abstract class is only to be sub-classed (inherited from). In other words, it only allows other classes to inherit from it but cannot be instantiated. The advantage is that it enforces certain hierarchies for all the subclasses. </p>
<p><strong>In simple words, it is a kind of contract that forces all the subclasses to carry on the same hierarchies or standards.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract class couldn’t be instantiated, except in the context of instantiating a class that dervies from it.</strong></p>
<h3 id="Interface">Interface</h3><p>An interface is not a class. It is an entity that is defined by the word Interface. An interface has no implementation; it only has the signature or in other words, just the definition of the methods without the body. As one of the similarities to Abstract class, it is a contract that is used to define hierarchies for all subclasses or it defines specific set of methods and their arguments. The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class. Since C# doesn’t support multiple inheritance, interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>interface can’t have contructor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interface only have method declaration without modifiers since everything is public.</strong></p>

<p>Abstract classes also allow for this kind of polymorphism, but with a few caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes may inherit from only one base class, so if you want to use abstract classes to provide polymorphism to a group of classes, they must all inherit from that class.</li>
<li>Abstract classes may also provide members that have already been implemented. Therefore, you can ensure a certain amount of identical functionality with an abstract class, but cannot with an interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some recommendations to help you to decide whether to use an interface or an abstract class to provide polymorphism for your components.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you anticipate creating multiple versions of your component, create an abstract class. Abstract classes provide a simple and easy way to version your components. By updating the base class, all inheriting classes are automatically updated with the change. Interfaces, on the other hand, cannot be changed once created. If a new version of an interface is required, you must create a whole new interface.</li>
<li>If the functionality you are creating will be useful across a wide range of disparate objects, use an interface. Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, whereas interfaces are best suited for providing common functionality to unrelated classes.</li>
<li>If you are designing small, concise bits of functionality, use interfaces. If you are designing large functional units, use an abstract class.</li>
<li>If you want to provide common, implemented functionality among all implementations of your component, use an abstract class. Abstract classes allow you to partially implement your class, whereas interfaces contain no implementation for any members.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Multiple_Inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</h3><p>For the rare cases that require a multiple-inheritance class structure, one solution is to use aggregation; instead of one class inheriting from another, one class contains an instance of the other. Figure 6.2 shows an example of this class structure. Aggregation occurs when the association relationship defines a core part of the containing object. For multiple inheritance, this involves picking one class as the primary base class (PdaItem) and deriving a new class (Contact) from that. The second desired base class (Person) is added as a field in the derived class (Contact). Next, all the nonprivate members on the field (Person) are redefined on the derived class (Contact) which then delegates the calls out to the field (Person). Some code duplication occurs because methods are redeclared; however, this is minimal, since the real method body is implemented only within the aggregated class (Person).</p>
<h3 id="Explicit_Interface_Implementation">Explicit Interface Implementation</h3><p>If a class implements two interfaces that contain a member with the same signature, then implementing that member on the class will cause both interfaces to use that member as their implementation.</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">class Test </span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    static void Main()</span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        SampleClass sc = new SampleClass();</span><br><span class="line">        IControl ctrl = (IControl)sc;</span><br><span class="line">        ISurface srfc = (ISurface)sc;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        // The following lines all call the same method.</span><br><span class="line">        sc.Paint();</span><br><span class="line">        ctrl.Paint();</span><br><span class="line">        srfc.Paint();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">interface IControl</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    void Paint();</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">interface ISurface</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    void Paint();</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    // Both ISurface.Paint and IControl.Paint call this method. </span><br><span class="line">    public void Paint()</span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        Console.WriteLine("Paint method in SampleClass");</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">// Output:</span><br><span class="line">// Paint method in SampleClass</span><br><span class="line">// Paint method in SampleClass</span><br><span class="line">// Paint method in SampleClass</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>If the two interface members do not perform the same function, however, this can lead to an incorrect implementation of one or both of the interfaces. It is possible to implement an interface member explicitly—creating a class member that is only called through the interface, and is specific to that interface. This is accomplished by naming the class member with the name of the interface and a period. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">public class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    void IControl.Paint()</span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        System.Console.WriteLine("IControl.Paint");</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    void ISurface.Paint()</span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        System.Console.WriteLine("ISurface.Paint");</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The class member IControl.Paint is only available through the IControl interface, and ISurface.Paint is only available through ISurface. Both method implementations are separate, and neither is available directly on the class. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Call the Paint methods from Main.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">SampleClass obj = <span class="keyword">new</span> SampleClass();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//obj.Paint();  // Compiler error.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">IControl c = (IControl)obj;</span><br><span class="line">c.Paint();  <span class="comment">// Calls IControl.Paint on SampleClass.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ISurface s = (ISurface)obj;</span><br><span class="line">s.Paint(); <span class="comment">// Calls ISurface.Paint on SampleClass.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Output:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// IControl.Paint</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// ISurface.Paint</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Explicit implementation is also used to resolve cases where two interfaces each declare different members of the same name such as a property and a method:</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="title">ILeft</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">int</span> P &#123; <span class="keyword">get</span>;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="title">IRight</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">P</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>To implement both interfaces, a class has to use explicit implementation either for the property P, or the method P, or both, to avoid a compiler error. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">class Middle : ILeft, IRight</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    public int P() &#123; return 0; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    int ILeft.P &#123; get &#123; return 0; &#125; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Enum">Enum</h2><p><code>System.Enum</code> is a reference type, but any specific enum type is a value type. </p>
<p>In the same way, <code>System.ValueType</code> is a reference type, but all types inheriting from it (other than System.Enum) are value types.</p>
<p>So if you have an enum <code>Foo</code> and you want a <strong>nullable</strong> property, you need the property type to be <code>Foo?</code>.</p>

<p>The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.</p>

<p><strong>protected internal</strong></p>
<p>The type or member can be accessed by any code in the <strong>same assembly</strong> in which it is declared, or from within <strong>a derived class in another assembly</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Access from another assembly</strong> must take place within <strong>a class declaration that derives from the class</strong> in which the protected internal element is declared, and it must take place through <strong>an instance of the derived class type</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="What_is_the_default_access_modifier_for_classes,_methods,_members,_constructors,_delegates_and_interfaces?">What is the default access modifier for classes, methods, members, constructors, delegates and interfaces?</h2><p>The default access for everything in C# is “the most restricted access you could declare for that member”.</p>

<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">namespace</span> <span class="title">MyCompany</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Outer</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">Foo</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Inner</span> &#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">namespace</span> <span class="title">MyCompany</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">internal</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Outer</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">Foo</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Inner</span> &#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The one sort of exception to this is making one part of a property (usually the setter) more restricted than the declared accessibility of the property itself:</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> Name</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">get</span> &#123; ... &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">set</span> &#123; ... &#125; <span class="comment">// This isn't the default, have to do it explicitly</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This is what the C# 3.0 specification has to say (section 3.5.1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on the context in which a member declaration takes place, only certain types of declared accessibility are permitted. Furthermore, when a member declaration does not include any access modifiers, the context in which the declaration takes place determines the default declared accessibility.</p>
<p>Namespaces implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on namespace declarations.</p>
<p>Types declared in compilation units or namespaces can have public or internal declared accessibility and default to internal declared accessibility.</p>
<p>Class members can have any of the five kinds of declared accessibility and default to private declared accessibility. (Note that a type declared as a member of a class can have any of the five kinds of declared accessibility, whereas a type declared as a member of a namespace can have only public or internal declared accessibility.)</p>
<p>Struct members can have public, internal, or private declared accessibility and default to private declared accessibility because <strong>structs are implicitly sealed</strong>. Struct members introduced in a struct (that is, not inherited by that struct) cannot have protected or protected internal declared accessibility. (Note that a type declared as a member of a struct can have public, internal, or private declared accessibility, whereas a type declared as a member of a namespace can have only public or internal declared accessibility.)</p>
<p>Interface members implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on interface member declarations.</p>
<p>Enumeration members implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on enumeration member declarations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that nested types would come under the “class members” or “struct members” parts - and therefore default to private visibility.)</p>
<h2 id="Structs">Structs</h2><p>*What is the keyword to define custom type?</p>
<p>“Struct”</p>
<p>Structs share most of the same syntax as classes, although structs are more limited than classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within a struct declaration, fields cannot be initialized unless they are declared as const or static.</li>
<li>A struct cannot declare a default constructor (a constructor without parameters) or a destructor.</li>
<li>Structs are copied on assignment. When a struct is assigned to a new variable, all the data is copied, and any modification to the new copy does not change the data for the original copy. This is important to remember when working with collections of value types such as Dictionary<string, mystruct="">.</string,></li>
<li>Structs are value types and classes are reference types.</li>
<li>Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using a new operator.</li>
<li>Structs can declare constructors that have parameters.</li>
<li>A struct cannot inherit from another struct or class, and it cannot be the base of a class. All structs inherit directly from System.ValueType, which inherits from System.Object.</li>
<li>A struct can implement interfaces.</li>
<li>A struct can be used as a nullable type and can be assigned a null value.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Reflection">Reflection</h2><p>In computer science, reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.</p>
<h3 id="Uses">Uses</h3><p>Reflection can be used for observing and modifying program execution at runtime. A reflection-oriented program component can monitor the execution of an enclosure of code and can modify itself according to a desired goal related to that enclosure. This is typically accomplished by dynamically assigning program code at runtime.</p>
<p>In object oriented programming languages such as Java, reflection allows inspection of classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime without knowing the names of the interfaces, fields, methods at compile time. It also allows instantiation of new objects and invocation of methods.</p>
<p>Reflection can also be used to adapt a given program to different situations dynamically. For example, consider an application that uses two different classes X and Y interchangeably to perform similar operations. Without reflection-oriented programming, the application might be hard-coded to call method names of class X and class Y. However, using the reflection-oriented programming paradigm, the application could be designed and written to utilize reflection in order to invoke methods in classes X and Y without hard-coding method names. Reflection-oriented programming almost always requires additional knowledge, framework, relational mapping, and object relevance in order to take advantage of more generic code execution.</p>
<p>Reflection is often used as part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.</p>
<p>Reflection is also a key strategy for metaprogramming.</p>
<p>In some object-oriented programming languages, such as C# and Java, reflection can be used to override member accessibility rules. For example, reflection makes it possible to change the value of a field marked “private” in a third-party library’s class.</p>

<h2 id="LINQ">LINQ</h2><p>Rather than add relational or XML-specific features to our programming languages and runtime, with the LINQ project we have taken</p>
<p><strong> a more general approach and are adding general-purpose query facilities to the .NET Framework that apply to all sources of information, not just relational or XML data. </strong></p>
<p>This facility is called .NET Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).</p>
<h3 id="Benfits-1">Benfits</h3><p>We use the term language-integrated query to indicate that </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Query is an integrated feature of the developer’s primary programming languages (for example, Visual C#, Visual Basic).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Language-integrated query allows query expressions to benefit from the rich metadata,</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile-time syntax checking,</p>
</li>
<li><p>static typing </p>
</li>
<li><p>IntelliSense that was previously available only to imperative code. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Language-integrated query also allows a single general purpose declarative query facility to be applied to all in-memory information, not just information from external sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Implementation-1">Implementation</h3><p>.NET Language-Integrated Query defines a set of general purpose standard query operators that allow traversal, filter, and projection operations to be expressed in a direct yet declarative way in any .NET-based programming language.</p>
<p>The standard query operators allow queries to be applied to any IEnumerable<t>-based information source.</t></p>
<p>LINQ allows third parties to augment the set of standard query operators with new domain-specific operators that are appropriate for the target domain or technology.</p>
<p>More importantly, third parties are also free to replace the standard query operators with their own implementations that provide additional services such as remote evaluation, query translation, optimization, and so on. </p>
<p>By adhering to the conventions of the LINQ pattern, such implementations enjoy the same language integration and tool support as the standard query operators.</p>
<p>The extensibility of the query architecture is used in the LINQ project itself to provide implementations that work over both XML and SQL data. </p>
<p>The query operators over XML (LINQ to XML) use an efficient, easy-to-use, in-memory XML facility to provide XPath/XQuery functionality in the host programming language.</p>
<p>The query operators over relational data (LINQ to SQL) build on the integration of SQL-based schema definitions into the common language runtime (CLR) type system. </p>
<p>This integration provides strong typing over relational data while retaining the expressive power of the relational model and the performance of query evaluation directly in the underlying store.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It makes it easier to manage complexity by dividing an application into the model, the<br>view, and the controller.</p>

<li><p>It does not use view state or serverbased forms. This makes the MVC framework ideal<br>for developers who want full control over the behavior of an application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It uses a Front Controller pattern that processes Web application requests through a<br>single controller. This enables you to design an application that supports a rich routing<br>infrastructure. For more information, see Front Controller on the MSDN Web site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It provides better support for testdriven development (TDD).</p>

<h2 id="What_is_Partial_View?_What_is_ChildAction,cant_be_call_directly,_generate_PartialView">What is Partial View? What is ChildAction,cant be call directly, generate PartialView</h2><p>Partial view is special view which renders a portion of view content. It is just like a user control web form application. Partial can be reusable in multiple views. It helps us to reduce code duplication. In other word a partial view enables us to render a view within the parent view.</p>
<p>@Html.Partial(“PartialViewExample”)  </p>
<p>@Html.RenderPartial(“PartialViewExample”)</p>
<h2 id="ChildAction">ChildAction</h2><p>The ChildActionOnly attribute ensures that an action method can be called only as a child method from within a view. An action method doesn’t need to have this attribute to be used as a child action, but we tend to use this attribute to prevent the action methods from being invoked as a result of a user request. Having defined an action method, we need to create what will be rendered when the action is invoked. Child actions are typically associated with partial views, although this is not compulsory.</p>
<p>[ChildActionOnly] allowing restricted access via code in View.</p>
<p>Phil Haack explains it nicely in this blog post. Basically a child action is a controller action that you could invoke from the view using the Html.Action helper:</p>
<p><code>@Html.Action(&quot;SomeActionName&quot;, &quot;SomeController&quot;)</code></p>
<p>This action will then execute and render its output at the specified location in the view. The difference with a Partial is that a partial only includes the specified markup, there’s no other action executing than the main action.</p>
<p>So you basically have the main action which received the request and rendered a view, but from within this view you could render multiple child actions which will go through their independent MVC lifecycle and eventually render the output. And all this will happen in the context of a single HTTP request.</p>
<p>Child actions are useful for creating entire reusable widgets which could be embedded into your views and which go through their independent MVC lifecycle.Child</p>

<h2 id="What’s_view_model-">What’s view model.</h2><p>A view model represents only the data that you want to display on your view/page, whether it be used for static text or for input values (like textboxes and dropdowns).</p>
<h2 id="View_Model_Validation-_FlurentValidation-_MVC_dataAnnotation-">View Model Validation. FlurentValidation. MVC dataAnnotation.</h2><h2 id="Razor">Razor</h2><h2 id="Filters_in_ASP-NET_MVC">Filters in ASP.NET MVC</h2><p>In ASP.NET MVC, controllers define action methods that usually have a one-to-one relationship with possible user interactions, such as clicking a link or submitting a form. </p>
<p>For example, when the user clicks a link, a request is routed to the designated controller, and the corresponding action method is called.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to perform logic either before an action method is called or after an action method runs. </p>
<p>To support this, ASP.NET MVC provides filters. </p>
<p>Filters are custom classes that provide both a declarative and programmatic means to add pre-action and post-action behavior to controller action methods.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC Filter Types</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC supports the following types of action filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IAuthorizationFilter and make security decisions about whether to execute an action method, such as performing authentication or validating properties of the request. </p>
<p>The AuthorizeAttribute class and the RequireHttpsAttribute class are examples of an authorization filter. </p>
<p>Authorization filters run before any other filter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Action filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IActionFilter and wrap the action method execution. </p>
<p>The IActionFilter interface declares two methods: OnActionExecuting and OnActionExecuted. </p>
<p>OnActionExecuting runs before the action method. </p>
<p>OnActionExecuted runs after the action method and can perform additional processing, such as providing extra data to the action method, inspecting the return value, or canceling execution of the action method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Result filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IResultFilter and wrap execution of the ActionResult object. </p>
<p>IResultFilter declares two methods: OnResultExecuting and OnResultExecuted. </p>
<p>OnResultExecuting runs before the ActionResult object is executed. </p>
<p>OnResultExecuted runs after the result and can perform additional processing of the result, such as modifying the HTTP response. </p>
<p>The OutputCacheAttribute class is one example of a result filter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exception filters. </li>
</ul>
<p>These implement IExceptionFilter and execute if there is an unhandled exception thrown during the execution of the ASP.NET MVC pipeline. </p>
<p>Exception filters can be used for tasks such as logging or displaying an error page. </p>
<p>The HandleErrorAttribute class is one example of an exception filter.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Controller class implements each of the filter interfaces. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can implement any of the filters for a specific controller by overriding the controller’s On<filter> method. </filter></p>
<p>For example, you can override the OnAuthorization method. </p>
<p>The simple controller included in the downloadable sample overrides each of the filters and writes out diagnostic information when each filter runs. </p>
<p>You can implement the following On<filter> methods in a controller.</filter></p>
<p><code>[Authorize]</code><br><code>[OutputCache(Duration=10)]</code><br><code>[HandleError]</code><br><code>[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</code><br><code>[ValidateInput(false)]</code><br><code>[AllowAnonymous]</code><br><code>[HttpPost]</code><br><code>[HttpGet]</code></p>

<h2 id="OO_Plinciple">OO Plinciple</h2><h3 id="Encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3><p>In a nutshell, encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors and mutators。</p>
<h3 id="Abstraction">Abstraction</h3><p>The best definition of abstraction I’ve ever read is: “An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of object and thus provide crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective of the viewer.” — G. Booch, Object-Oriented Design With Applications, Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, California, 1991.</p>
<p>Data abstraction is nothing more than the implementation of an object that contains the same essential properties and actions we can find in the original object we are representing.</p>
<h3 id="Inheritance">Inheritance</h3><p>“Is a” is the inheritance way of object relationship.</p>
<p>Rather than duplicate functionality, inheritance allows you to inherit functionality from another class, called a superclass or base class.</p>
<h3 id="Polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3><p>“Poly” meaning “many” and “morph” meaning “form,” polymorphism refers to the fact that there are multiple implementations of the same signature. And since the same signature cannot be used multiple times within a single class, each implementation of the member signature occurs on a different class.</p>
<p>Polymorphism manifests itself by having multiple methods all with the same name, but slighty different functionality.</p>
<p>There are 2 basic types of polymorphism.<br>Overridding, also called run-time polymorphism, and overloading, which is referred to as compile-time polymorphism.  This difference is, for method overloading, the compiler determines which method will be executed, and this decision is made when the code gets compiled.<br>Which method will be used for method overriding is determined at runtime based on the dynamic type of an object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Poly” meaning “many” and “morph” meaning “form,” polymorphism refers to the fact that there are multiple implementations of the same signature. And since the same signature cannot be used multiple times within a single class, each implementation of the member signature occurs on a different class.<br>The idea behind polymorphism is that the object itself knows best how to perform a particular operation, and by enforcing common ways to invoke those operations, polymorphism is also a technique for encouraging code reuse when taking advantage of the commonalities. Given multiple types of documents, each document type class knows best how to perform a Print() method for its corresponding document type. Therefore, instead of defining a single print method that includes a switch statement with the special logic to print each document type, with polymorphism you call the Print() method corresponding to the specific type of document you wish to print. For example, calling Print() on a word processing document class behaves according to word processing specifics, and calling the same method on a graphics document class will result in print behavior specific to the graphic. Given the document types, however, all you have to do to print a document is to call Print(), regardless of the type.</p>
<p>Moving the custom print implementation out of a switch statement offers a number of maintenance advantages. First, the implementation appears in the context of each document type’s class rather than in a location far removed; this is in keeping with encapsulation. Second, adding a new document type doesn’t require a change to the switch statement. Instead, all that is necessary is for the new document type class to implement the Print() signature.</p>

<h2 id="Singleton_Pattern">Singleton Pattern</h2><blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Benifits:-1">Benifits:</h3><blockquote>
<p>This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. </p>
<p>The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Implementation-2">Implementation</h3><blockquote>
<p>Implementation of a singleton pattern must satisfy the single instance and global access principles.</p>
<p>It requires a mechanism to access the singleton class member without creating a class object and a mechanism to persist the value of class members among class objects.</p>
<p>The singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one does not exist. </p>
<p>If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object. </p>
<p>To make sure that the object cannot be instantiated any other way, the constructor is made private. </p>
<p>Note the distinction between a simple static instance of a class and a singleton: although a singleton can be implemented as a static instance, it can also be lazily constructed, requiring no memory or resources until needed.</p>
<p>The singleton pattern must be carefully constructed in multi-threaded applications. </p>
<p>If two threads are to execute the creation method at the same time when a singleton does not yet exist, they both must check for an instance of the singleton and then only one should create the new one.</p>
<p>If the programming language has concurrent processing capabilities the method should be constructed to execute as a mutually exclusive operation. </p>
<p>The classic solution to this problem is to use mutual exclusion on the class that indicates that the object is being instantiated.</p>

<h3 id="IOC:">IOC:</h3><p>In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle in which custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. </p>
<p>A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.</p>
<p>Inversion of control is used to increase modularity of the program and make it extensible,[1] and has applications in object-oriented programming and other programming paradigms. </p>
<p>The term was popularized by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler.</p>
<p>The term is related to, but different from, the dependency inversion principle, which concerns itself with decoupling dependencies between high-level and low-level layers through shared abstractions.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>As an example, with traditional programming, the main function of an application might make function calls into a menu library to display a list of available commands and query the user to select one.[2] The library thus would return the chosen option as the value of the function call, and the main function uses this value to execute the associated command. This style was common in text based interfaces. For example, an email client may show a screen with commands to load new mails, answer the current mail, start a new mail, etc., and the program execution would block until the user presses a key to select a command.</p>
<p>With inversion of control, on the other hand, the program would be written using a software framework that knows common behavioral and graphical elements, such as windowing systems, menus, controlling the mouse, and so on. The custom code “fills in the blanks” for the framework, such as supplying a table of menu items and registering a code subroutine for each item, but it is the framework that monitors the user’s actions and invokes the subroutine when a menu item is selected. In the mail client example, the framework could follow both the keyboard and mouse inputs and call the command invoked by the user by either means, and at the same time monitor the network interface to find out if new messages arrive and refresh the screen when some network activity is detected. The same framework could be used as the skeleton for a spreadsheet program or a text editor. Conversely, the framework knows nothing about Web browsers, spreadsheets or text editors; implementing their functionality takes custom code.</p>
<p>Inversion of control carries the strong connotation that the reusable code and the problem-specific code are developed independently even though they operate together in an application. Software frameworks, callbacks, schedulers, event loops and dependency injection are examples of design patterns that follow the inversion of control principle, although the term is most commonly used in the context of object-oriented programming.</p>
<p><strong> Description </strong><br>In traditional programming, the flow of the business logic is determined by objects that are statically bound to one another. With inversion of control, the flow depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution. Such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions. This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator. In IoC, the code could also be linked statically during compilation, but finding the code to execute by reading its description from external configuration instead of with a direct reference in the code itself.</p>
<p>In dependency injection, a dependent object or module is coupled to the object it needs at run time. Which particular object will satisfy the dependency during program execution typically cannot be known at compile time using static analysis. While described in terms of object interaction here, the principle can apply to other programming methodologies besides object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>In order for the running program to bind objects to one another, the objects must possess compatible interfaces. For example, class A may delegate behavior to interface I which is implemented by class B; the program instantiates A and B, and then injects B into A.</p>
<p><strong> Benfits </strong><br>Inversion of control serves the following design purposes:</p>
<p><em>To decouple the execution of a task from implementation.
</em>To focus a module on the task it is designed for.<br><em>To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on contracts.
</em>To prevent side effects when replacing a module.</p>
<p>Inversion of control is sometimes facetiously referred to as the “Hollywood Principle: Don’t call us, we’ll call you”.</p>
<p><strong> How to implement </strong><br>In object-oriented programming, there are several basic techniques to implement inversion of control. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a factory pattern</li>
<li>Using a service locator pattern</li>
<li>Using a dependency injection, for example<ul>
<li>A constructor injection</li>
<li>A parameter injection</li>
<li>A setter injection</li>
<li>An interface injection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using a contextualized lookup</li>
<li>Using template method design pattern</li>
<li>Using strategy design pattern</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="DI">DI</h3><p>A dependency is an object that can be used (a service). An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it.</p>
<p>The service is made part of the client’s state. Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.</p>
<p>Dependency injection allows a program design to follow the dependency inversion principle.</p>
<p>The client delegates to external code (the injector) the responsibility of providing its dependencies. </p>
<p>The client is not allowed to call the injector code. </p>
<p>It is the injecting code that constructs the services and calls the client to inject them. </p>
<p>This means the client code does not need to know about the injecting code. </p>
<p>The client does not need to know how to construct the services. </p>
<p>The client does not need to know which actual services it is using.</p>
<p>The client only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how the client may use the services. This separates the responsibilities of use and construction.</p>
<p><strong> Taxonomy </strong></p>
<p>Inversion of Control (IoC) is more general than DI. </p>
<p>Put simply, IoC means letting other code call you rather than insisting on doing the calling. </p>
<p>An example of IoC without DI is the template pattern. Here polymorphism is achieved through subclassing, that is, inheritance.</p>
<p>Dependency injection implements IoC through composition so is often identical to that of the strategy pattern, but while the strategy pattern is intended for dependencies to be interchangeable throughout an object’s lifetime, in dependency injection it may be that only a single instance of a dependency is used. </p>
<p>This still achieves polymorphism, but through delegation and composition.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency injection allows a client the flexibility of being configurable. Only the client’s behavior is fixed. The client may act on anything that supports the intrinsic interface the client expects.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can be used to externalize a system’s configuration details into configuration files allowing the system to be reconfigured without recompilation. Separate configurations can be written for different situations that require different implementations of components. This includes, but is not limited to, testing.</li>
<li>Because dependency injection doesn’t require any change in code behavior it can be applied to legacy code as a refactoring. The result is clients that are more independent and that are easier to unit test in isolation using stubs or mock objects that simulate other objects not under test. This ease of testing is often the first benefit noticed when using dependency injection.</li>
<li>Dependency injection allows a client to remove all knowledge of a concrete implementation that it needs to use. This helps isolate the client from the impact of design changes and defects. It promotes reusability, testability and maintainability.</li>
<li>Reduction of boilerplate code in the application objects since all work to initialize or set up dependencies is handled by a provider component.</li>
<li>Dependency injection allows concurrent or independent development. Two developers can independently develop classes that use each other, while only needing to know the interface the classes will communicate through. Plugins are often developed by third party shops that never even talk to the developers who created the product that uses the plugins.</li>
<li>Dependency Injection decreases coupling between a class and its dependency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency injection creates clients that demand configuration details be supplied by construction code. This can be onerous when obvious defaults are available.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can make code difficult to trace (read) because it separates behavior from construction. This means developers must refer to more files to follow how a system performs.</li>
<li>Dependency injection typically requires more upfront development effort since one can not summon into being something right when and where it is needed but must ask that it be injected and then ensure that it is injected.</li>
<li>Dependency injection can cause an explosion of types, especially in languages that have explicit interface types, like Java and C#</li>
<li>Dependency injection forces complexity to move out of classes and into the linkages between classes which might not always be desirable or easily managed.</li>
<li>Ironically, dependency injection can encourage dependence on a dependency injection framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependency injection is a specific type of IoC using contextualized lookup.</p>
<h3 id="Interface_injection_comparison">Interface injection comparison</h3><p>The advantage of interface injection is that dependencies can be completely ignorant of their clients yet can still receive a reference to a new client and, using it, send a reference-to-self back to the client. In this way, the dependencies become injectors. The key is that the injecting method (which could just be a classic setter method) is provided through an interface.</p>
<p>An assembler is still needed to introduce the client and its dependencies. The assembler would take a reference to the client, cast it to the setter interface that sets that dependency, and pass it to that dependency object which would turn around and pass a reference-to-self back to the client.</p>
<p>For interface injection to have value, the dependency must do something in addition to simply passing back a reference to itself. This could be acting as a factory or sub-assembler to resolve other dependencies, thus abstracting some details from the main assembler. It could be reference-counting so that the dependency knows how many clients are using it. If the dependency maintains a collection of clients, it could later inject them all with a different instance of itself.</p>
<p>Interface injection:</p>
<p>This is simply the client publishing a role interface to the setter methods of the client’s dependencies. It can be used to establish how the injector should talk to the client when injecting dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="Index">Index</h2><p>A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and the use of more storage space to maintain the extra copy of data.</p>
<p>Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed.</p>
<p>Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table , providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records.</p>
<p>An index is a copy of select columns of data from a table that can be searched very efficiently that also includes a low level disk block address or direct link to the complete row of data it was copied from.</p>

There can therefore be only <span class="constant">one</span> clustered index.

<span class="number">2.</span> With <span class="operator">a</span> non clustered index there is <span class="operator">a</span> <span class="keyword">second</span> list that has pointers <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="operator">the</span> physical rows.

Writing <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="operator">a</span> table <span class="operator">with</span> <span class="operator">a</span> clustered index can be slower, <span class="keyword">if</span> there is <span class="operator">a</span> need <span class="built_in">to</span> rearrange <span class="operator">the</span> data.
</code></pre><h2 id="Clustered">Clustered</h2><p>Clustering alters the data block into a certain distinct order to match the index, resulting in the row data being stored in order. Therefore, only one clustered index can be created on a given database table.</p>
<p>Clustered indices can greatly increase overall speed of retrieval, but usually only where the data is accessed sequentially in the same or reverse order of the clustered index, or when a range of items is selected.</p>
<p>Since the physical records are in this sort order on disk, the next row item in the sequence is immediately before or after the last one, and so fewer data block reads are required.</p>
<p>The primary feature of a clustered index is therefore the ordering of the physical data rows in accordance with the index blocks that point to them. Some databases separate the data and<br>index blocks into separate files, others put two completely different data blocks within the same physical file(s).</p>

<li>WITH (NOLOCK) </li>
</ul>
<p>WITH (NOLOCK) is the equivalent of using READ UNCOMMITED as a transaction isolation level. So, you stand the risk of reading an uncommitted row that is subsequently rolled back, i.e. data that never made it into the database. So, while it can prevent reads being deadlocked by other operations, it comes with a risk. In a banking application with high transaction rates, it’s probably not going to be the right solution to whatever problem you’re trying to solve with it IMHO.</p>
<p>A SELECT in SQL Server will place a shared lock on a table row - and a second SELECT would also require a shared lock, and those are compatible with one another.</p>
<p>So no - one SELECT cannot block another SELECT.</p>
<p>What the WITH (NOLOCK) query hint is used for is to be able to read data that’s in the process of being inserted (by another connection) and that hasn’t been committed yet.</p>
<p>Without that query hint, a SELECT might be blocked reading a table by an ongoing INSERT (or UPDATE) statement that places an exclusive lock on rows (or possibly a whole table), until that operation’s transaction has been committed (or rolled back).</p>
<p>Problem of the WITH (NOLOCK) hint is: you might be reading data rows that aren’t going to be inserted at all, in the end (if the INSERT transaction is rolled back) - so your e.g. report might show data that’s never really been committed to the database.</p>
<p>There’s another query hint that might be useful - WITH (READPAST). This instructs the SELECT command to just skip any rows that it attempts to read and that are locked exclusively. The SELECT will not block, and it will not read any “dirty” un-committed data - but it might skip some rows, e.g. not show all your rows in the table.</p>

<h2 id="Sql_injection">Sql injection</h2><h2 id="ASP-NET_MVC_Filter_for_Security">ASP.NET MVC Filter for Security</h2><p>HttpPost and HttpGet 的 attitudes<br>[ ValidateAntiForgeryToken ]</p>
<p>MVC’s anti-forgery support writes a unique value to an HTTP-only cookie and then the same value is written to the form. When the page is submitted, an error is raised if the cookie value doesn’t match the form value.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the feature prevents cross site request forgeries. That is, a form from another site that posts to your site in an attempt to submit hidden content using an authenticated user’s credentials. The attack involves tricking the logged in user into submitting a form, or by simply programmatically triggering a form when the page loads.</p>
<p>The feature doesn’t prevent any other type of data forgery or tampering based attacks.</p>
<p>To use it, decorate the action method or controller with the ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute and place a call to @Html.AntiForgeryToken() in the forms posting to the method.</p>
<p>[ ValidateInput ( false )]<br>[ AllowHTML ]</p>
<p>XSS (cross-site scripting) is a security attack where the attacker injects malicious code while doing data entry. Now the good news is that XSS is by default prevented in MVC. So if any one tries to post Javasript or HTML code he lands with the below error.</p>
<p>Enter image description here</p>
<p>But in real time there are scenarios where HTML has to be allowed, like HTML editors. So for those kind of scenarios you can decorate your action with the below attribute.</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[ValidateInput(<span class="keyword">false</span>)]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> ActionResult <span class="title">PostProduct</span>(<span class="params">Product obj</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> View(obj);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>But wait, there is a problem here. The problem is we have allowed HTML on the complete action which can be dangerous. So if we can have more granular control on the field or property level that would really create a neat, tidy and professional solution.</p>
<p>That’s where AllowHTML is useful. You can see in the below code I have decorated “AllowHTML” on the product class property level.</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Product</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> ProductName &#123; <span class="keyword">get</span>; <span class="keyword">set</span>; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    [AllowHtml]</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> ProductDescription &#123; <span class="keyword">get</span>; <span class="keyword">set</span>; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>So summarizing “ValidateInput” allows scripts and HTML to be posted on action level while “AllowHTML” is on a more granular level.</p>
<p>I would recommend to use “AllowHTML” more until you are very sure that the whole action needs to be naked.</p>
<p>I would recommend you to read the blog post Preventing XSS Attacks in ASP.NET MVC using ValidateInput and AllowHTML which demonstrates step by step about the importance of these two attributes with an example.</p>

<h1 id="GC">GC</h1><p>In computer science , garbage collection ( GC ) is a form of automatic memory management .<br>The garbage collector , or just collector , attempts to reclaim garbage , or memory occupied by<br>objects that are no longer in use by the program . Garbage collection was invented by John<br>McCarthy around 1959 to solve problems in Lisp.</p>
<p>Garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of manual memory management , which<br>requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory<br>system. However, many systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques<br>such as stack allocation and region inference . Like other memory management techniques,<br>garbage collection may take a significant proportion of total processing time in a program and<br>can thus have significant influence on performance.</p>
<p>Resources other than memory, such as network sockets , database handles , user interaction<br>windows, and file and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection.<br>Methods used to manage such resources, particularly destructors , may suffice to manage<br>memory as well, leaving no need for GC. Some GC systems allow such other resources to be<br>associated with a region of memory that, when collected, causes the other resource to be<br>reclaimed; this is called finalization . Finalization may introduce complications limiting its<br>usability, such as intolerable latency between disuse and reclaim of especially limited resources,<br>or a lack of control over which thread performs the work of reclaiming.</p>
<h2 id="Advantages">Advantages</h2><p>Garbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory deallocation. As a<br>result, certain categories of bugs are eliminated or substantially reduced:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dangling pointer bugs , which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are<br>still pointers to it, and one of those pointers is dereferenced. By then the memory<br>may have been reassigned to another use, with unpredictable results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double free bugs , which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory<br>that has already been freed, and perhaps already been allocated again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Certain kinds of memory leaks , in which a program fails to free memory occupied by<br>objects that have become unreachable , which can lead to memory exhaustion.<br>(Garbage collection typically does not deal with the unbounded accumulation of data<br>that is reachable, but that will actually not be used by the program.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Efficient implementations of persistent data structures<br>Some of the bugs addressed by garbage collection can have security implications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2><p>Typically, garbage collection has certain disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Garbage collection consumes computing resources in deciding which memory to<br>free, even though the programmer may have already known this information. The<br>penalty for the convenience of not annotating object lifetime manually in the source<br>code is overhead , which can lead to decreased or uneven performance. Interaction<br>with memory hierarchy effects can make this overhead intolerable in circumstances<br>that are hard to predict or to detect in routine testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting<br>in stalls scattered throughout a session. Unpredictable stalls can be unacceptable in<br>realtime environments , in transaction processing , or in interactive programs.<br>Incremental, concurrent, and realtime garbage collectors address these problems, with varying tradeoffs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nondeterministic GC is incompatible with RAII based management of nonGCed<br>resources. As a result, the need for explicit manual resource management<br>(release/close) for nonGCed resources becomes transitive to composition. That is:<br>in a nondeterministic GC system, if a resource or a resourcelike<br>object requires manual resource management (release/close), and this object is used as ‘part of’<br>another object, then the composed object will also become a resourcelike<br>object that itself requires manual resource management (release/close).</p>

<pre><code><span class="string">"I need to update the local inventory database with the inventory information from multiple suppliers. The suppliers...

provide Web service-based interface. As the application does not have any server side component (the application is a fat client talking directly to the database), is it possible to consume these Web services directly from my application database?"</span>

Do similar questions trouble you? Ever wondered what could be <span class="keyword">the</span> solution <span class="keyword">to</span> such problems? To <span class="type">date</span>, we have been familiar <span class="keyword">with</span> consuming Web services within <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="type">application</span> <span class="keyword">that</span> fetches <span class="keyword">the</span> data <span class="keyword">from</span> various databases.

There <span class="keyword">is</span> a different perspective, <span class="keyword">where</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> databases act <span class="keyword">as</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> service consumer <span class="keyword">in</span> contrast <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> normal norm <span class="keyword">of</span> acting <span class="keyword">as</span> a service provider. Here <span class="keyword">is</span> how you can invoke a Web service via database stored procedures.

A Web service, <span class="keyword">in</span> very broad terms, <span class="keyword">is</span> a method <span class="keyword">of</span> communication <span class="keyword">between</span> two applications <span class="keyword">or</span> electronic devices <span class="keyword">over</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> World Wide Web (WWW). Web services are <span class="keyword">of</span> two kinds: Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) <span class="keyword">and</span> Representational State Transfer (REST).

SOAP defines a standard communication protocol (<span class="keyword">set</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> rules) specification <span class="keyword">for</span> XML-based message exchange. SOAP uses different transport protocols, such <span class="keyword">as</span> HTTP <span class="keyword">and</span> SMTP. The standard protocol HTTP makes <span class="keyword">it</span> easier <span class="keyword">for</span> SOAP model <span class="keyword">to</span> tunnel across firewalls <span class="keyword">and</span> proxies <span class="keyword">without</span> any modifications <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> SOAP protocol. SOAP can sometimes be slower than middleware technologies like CORBA <span class="keyword">or</span> ICE due <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">its</span> verbose XML format.

REST describes a <span class="keyword">set</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> architectural principles <span class="keyword">by</span> which data can be transmitted <span class="keyword">over</span> a standardized interface (such <span class="keyword">as</span> HTTP). REST <span class="keyword">does not contain</span> an additional messaging layer <span class="keyword">and</span> focuses <span class="function_start"><span class="keyword">on</span></span> design rules <span class="keyword">for</span> creating stateless services. A client can access <span class="keyword">the</span> resource using <span class="keyword">the</span> unique URI <span class="keyword">and</span> a representation <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> resource <span class="keyword">is</span> returned. With each new resource representation, <span class="keyword">the</span> client <span class="keyword">is</span> said <span class="keyword">to</span> transfer state. While accessing RESTful resources <span class="keyword">with</span> HTTP protocol, <span class="keyword">the</span> URL <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> resource serves <span class="keyword">as</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> resource identifier <span class="keyword">and</span> GET, PUT, DELETE, POST <span class="keyword">and</span> HEAD are <span class="keyword">the</span> standard HTTP operations <span class="keyword">to</span> be performed <span class="function_start"><span class="keyword">on</span></span> <span class="keyword">that</span> resource.

REST vs. SOAP

Multiple factors need <span class="keyword">to</span> be considered when choosing a particular type <span class="keyword">of</span> Web service, <span class="keyword">that</span> <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="keyword">between</span> REST <span class="keyword">and</span> SOAP. The table <span class="keyword">below</span> breaks down <span class="keyword">the</span> features <span class="keyword">of</span> each Web service based <span class="function_start"><span class="keyword">on</span></span> personal experience.

REST

* The RESTful Web services are completely stateless. This can be tested <span class="keyword">by</span> restarting <span class="keyword">the</span> server <span class="keyword">and</span> checking <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> interactions are able <span class="keyword">to</span> survive.
* Restful services provide a good caching infrastructure <span class="keyword">over</span> HTTP GET method (<span class="keyword">for</span> most servers). This can improve <span class="keyword">the</span> performance, <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> data <span class="keyword">the</span> Web service returns <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> altered frequently <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> dynamic <span class="keyword">in</span> nature.
* The service producer <span class="keyword">and</span> service consumer need <span class="keyword">to</span> have a common understanding <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> context <span class="keyword">as</span> well <span class="keyword">as</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> content being passed along <span class="keyword">as</span> there <span class="keyword">is</span> no standard <span class="keyword">set</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> rules <span class="keyword">to</span> describe <span class="keyword">the</span> REST Web services interface.
* REST <span class="keyword">is</span> particularly useful <span class="keyword">for</span> restricted-profile devices such <span class="keyword">as</span> mobile <span class="keyword">and</span> PDAs <span class="keyword">for</span> which <span class="keyword">the</span> overhead <span class="keyword">of</span> additional parameters like headers <span class="keyword">and</span> other SOAP elements are less.
* REST services are easy <span class="keyword">to</span> integrate <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> existing websites <span class="keyword">and</span> are exposed <span class="keyword">with</span> XML so <span class="keyword">the</span> HTML pages can consume <span class="keyword">the</span> same <span class="keyword">with</span> ease. There <span class="keyword">is</span> hardly any need <span class="keyword">to</span> refactor <span class="keyword">the</span> existing website architecture. This makes developers more productive <span class="keyword">and</span> comfortable <span class="keyword">as</span> they will <span class="keyword">not</span> have <span class="keyword">to</span> rewrite everything <span class="keyword">from</span> scratch <span class="keyword">and</span> just need <span class="keyword">to</span> add <span class="function_start"><span class="keyword">on</span></span> <span class="keyword">the</span> existing functionality.
* REST-based implementation <span class="keyword">is</span> simple compared <span class="keyword">to</span> SOAP.

SOAP

* The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) <span class="keyword">contains</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> describes <span class="keyword">the</span> common <span class="keyword">set</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> rules <span class="keyword">to</span> define <span class="keyword">the</span> messages, bindings, operations <span class="keyword">and</span> location <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> Web service. WSDL <span class="keyword">is</span> a sort <span class="keyword">of</span> formal contract <span class="keyword">to</span> define <span class="keyword">the</span> interface <span class="keyword">that</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> Web service offers.
* SOAP requires less plumbing code than REST services design, (i.e., transactions, security, coordination, addressing, trust, etc.) Most <span class="type">real</span>-world applications are <span class="keyword">not</span> simple <span class="keyword">and</span> support complex operations, which require conversational state <span class="keyword">and</span> contextual information <span class="keyword">to</span> be maintained. With <span class="keyword">the</span> SOAP approach, developers need <span class="keyword">not</span> worry <span class="keyword">about</span> writing this plumbing code <span class="keyword">into</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="type">application</span> layer themselves.
* SOAP Web services (such <span class="keyword">as</span> JAX-WS) are useful <span class="keyword">in</span> handling asynchronous processing <span class="keyword">and</span> invocation.
* SOAP supports several protocols <span class="keyword">and</span> technologies, including WSDL, XSDs, SOAP, WS-Addressing
* In a nutshell, when you're publishing a complex <span class="type">application</span> program interface (API) <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> outside world, SOAP will be more useful. But when something <span class="keyword">with</span> a lower learning curve, <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="keyword">with</span> lightweight <span class="keyword">and</span> faster results <span class="keyword">and</span> simple transactions (i.e., CRUD operations) <span class="keyword">is</span> needed, <span class="keyword">my</span> vote goes <span class="keyword">to</span> REST.

<p>Soap Vs Rest<br>SOAP is definitely the heavyweight choice for Web service access. It provides the following advantages when compared to REST:</p>
<p>Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP)<br>Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication)<br>Standardized<br>Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards<br>Built-in error handling<br>Automation when used with certain language products<br>REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages when compared to SOAP:</p>
<p>No expensive tools require to interact with the Web service<br>Smaller learning curve<br>Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST can use smaller message formats)<br>Fast (no extensive processing required)<br>Closer to other Web technologies in design philosophy</p>
<h2 id="SOA">SOA</h2><p>A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology.</p>
<p>A service is a self-contained unit of functionality, such as retrieving an online bank statement. By that definition, a service is a discretely invokable operation. However, in the Web Services Definition Language (WSDL), a service is an interface definition that may list several discrete services/operations. And elsewhere, the term service is used for a component that is encapsulated behind an interface. This widespread ambiguity is reflected in what follows.</p>
<p>Services can be combined to provide the functionality of a large software application. SOA makes it easier for software components on computers connected over a network to cooperate. Every computer can run any number of services, and each service is built in a way that ensures that the service can exchange information with any other service in the network without human interaction and without the need to make changes to the underlying program itself.</p>
<h2 id="Process_Thread">Process Thread</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing" target="_blank" rel="external">Process</a>)</p>
<p>In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. </p>
<p>It contains the program code and its current activity. </p>
<p>Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing" target="_blank" rel="external">Thread</a>)</p>
<p>In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.</p>
<p>The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. </p>
<p>Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently (one starting before others finish) and share resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. </p>
<p>In particular, the threads of a process share its instructions (executable code) and its context (the values of its variables at any given time).</p>
<h2 id="How_many_ways_for_multi-thread_synchronisation">How many ways for multi-thread synchronisation</h2><p>For all other data types and non thread-safe resources, multithreading can only be safely performed using the <strong>constructs</strong> in this topic</p>
<h3 id="Lock">Lock</h3><p>The <strong>lock</strong> (C#) statements can be used to ensure that a block of code runs to completion without interruption by other threads. </p>
<h4 id="Lock_on_an_object">Lock on an object</h4><p>This is accomplished by obtaining a mutual-exclusion lock for a given object for the duration of the code block.</p>
<p>A <strong>lock</strong> statement is given an object as an argument, and is followed by a code block that is to be executed by only one thread at a time. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">TestThreading</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> System.Object lockThis = <span class="keyword">new</span> System.Object();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">Process</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span><br><span class="line">    </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">lock</span> (lockThis)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="comment">// Access thread-sensitive resources.</span></span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The <strong>argument</strong> provided to the <strong>lock</strong> keyword must be <strong>an object</strong> based on a reference type, and is used to <strong>define the scope of the lock</strong>. </p>
<p>In the example above, the lock scope is limited to this function because <strong>no references to the object <code>lockThis</code> exist outside the function</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If such a reference did exist, lock scope would extend to that object</strong>.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the object provided is used solely to <strong>uniquely identify the resource being shared among multiple threads</strong>, so it can be <strong>an arbitrary class instance</strong>. </p>
<p>In practice, however, this object usually represents <strong>the resource for which thread synchronization is necessary</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>E.G</strong> For example, if a container object is to be used by multiple threads, then the container can be passed to lock, and the synchronized code block following the lock would access the container. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long as other threads locks on the same contain before accessing it, then access to the object is safely synchronized.</p>
<p>Generally, it is <strong>best to avoid</strong><br>1.locking on a public type<br>2.locking on object instances beyond the control of your application. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>E.G</strong> For example, lock(this) can be problematic if the instance can be accessed publicly, because code beyond your control may lock on the object as well. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could create deadlock situations where two or more threads wait for the release of the same object. </p>
<h4 id="Lock_on_public_data_type">Lock on public data type</h4><p>Locking on a public data type, as opposed to an object, can cause problems for the same reason. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>E.G</strong> Locking on literal strings is especially risky because literal strings are interned by the common language runtime (CLR). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that there is one instance of any given string literal for the entire program, the exact same object represents the literal in all running application domains, on all threads. </p>
<p>As a result, a lock placed on a string with the same contents anywhere in the application process locks all instances of that string in the application. </p>
<p>As a result, it is best to lock a private or protected member that is not interned. </p>
<p>Some classes provide members specifically for locking. </p>
<p>The Array type, for example, provides SyncRoot. Many collection types provide a SyncRoot member as well.</p>
<p>The <strong>lock</strong> keyword marks a statement block as a critical section by obtaining the mutual-exclusion lock for a given object, executing a statement, and then releasing the lock. </p>
<p>The following example includes a lock statement.</p>

<p>The <strong>lock</strong> keyword ensures that one thread does not enter a critical section of code while another thread is in the critical section. If another thread tries to enter a locked code, it will wait, block, until the object is released.</p>
<p>The section Threading (C# and Visual Basic) discusses threading.</p>
<p>The <strong>lock</strong> keyword calls Enter at the start of the block and Exit at the end of the block. A ThreadInterruptedException is thrown if Interrupt interrupts a thread that is waiting to enter a lock statement.</p>
<p>In general, avoid locking on a public type, or instances beyond your code’s control. The common constructs lock (this), lock (typeof (MyType)), and lock (“myLock”) violate this guideline:<br><em>lock (this) is a problem if the instance can be accessed publicly.
</em>lock (typeof (MyType)) is a problem if MyType is publicly accessible.<br>*lock(“myLock”) is a problem because any other code in the process using the same string, will share the same lock.</p>
<p>Best practice is to define a private object to lock on, or a private static object variable to protect data common to all instances.</p>
<p>You can’t use the await keyword in the body of a lock statement.</p>

<h3 id="Monitors">Monitors</h3><p>Like the lock and SyncLock keywords, <strong>monitors</strong> prevent blocks of code from simultaneous execution by multiple threads. </p>
<p>The <strong>Enter</strong> method allows <strong>one and only one</strong> thread to proceed into the following statements; all other threads are blocked until the executing thread calls <strong>Exit</strong>. </p>
<p>This is just like using the lock keyword.</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">lock</span> (x)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    DoSomething();</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">System.Object obj = (System.Object)x;</span><br><span class="line">System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(obj);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">try</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    DoSomething();</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">finally</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    System.Threading.Monitor.Exit(obj);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Using the <strong>lock</strong> (C#) keyword is generally <strong>preferred over</strong> using the <strong>Monitor</strong> class directly, both because </p>
<ol>
<li>lock or SyncLock is more concise (adj. 简明的，简洁的; ; 简约; 精炼), </li>
<li>And because lock or SyncLock insures that the underlying monitor is released, even if the protected code throws an exception. This is accomplished (by “exit”) with the finally keyword, which executes its associated code block regardless of whether an exception is thrown.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Synchronization_Events_and_Wait_Handles">Synchronization Events and Wait Handles</h3><p>Using a lock or monitor is useful for preventing the simultaneous execution of thread-sensitive blocks of code, but these constructs do not allow one thread to <strong>communicate an event to another</strong>. </p>
<p>This requires synchronization events, which are objects that have one of two states, <strong>signaled</strong> and <strong>un-signaled</strong>, that can be used to <strong>activate</strong> and <strong>suspend threads</strong>. </p>
<p>Threads can be <strong>suspended</strong> by being made to wait on <strong>a synchronization event</strong> that is <strong>unsignaled</strong>, and can be <strong>activated</strong> by changing <strong>the event state</strong> to <strong>signaled</strong>. </p>
<p>If a thread attempts to wait on an event that is already signaled, then the thread continues to execute without delay.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of synchronization events:<br><em>AutoResetEvent
</em>ManualResetEvent</p>
<p>They differ only in that <strong>AutoResetEvent</strong> changes from <strong>signaled to unsignaled automatically any time it activates a thread</strong>. </p>
<p>Conversely, a <strong>ManualResetEvent</strong> allows any number of threads to be <strong>activated by its signaled state</strong>, and will only revert to <strong>an unsignaled state</strong> when its <strong>Reset method is called</strong>.</p>
<p>Threads can be made to wait on events by calling one of the wait methods, such as <strong>WaitOne</strong>, <strong>WaitAny</strong>, or <strong>WaitAll</strong>. </p>
<p><em>WaitHandle.WaitOne causes the thread to wait until a single event becomes signaled, </em>WaitHandle.WaitAny blocks a thread until one or more indicated events become signaled, *WaitHandle.WaitAll blocks the thread until all of the indicated events become signaled. </p>
<p>An event becomes signaled when its <strong>Set</strong> method is called.</p>
<p>In the following example, a thread is created and started by the Main function. </p>
<p>The new thread waits on an event using the WaitOne method. </p>
<p>The thread is suspended until the event becomes signaled by the primary thread that is executing the Main function. </p>
<p>Once the event becomes signaled, the auxiliary thread returns. </p>
<p>In this case, because the event is only used for one thread activation, either the AutoResetEvent or ManualResetEvent classes could be used.</p>

<h3 id="Mutex_Object">Mutex Object</h3><p>A mutex is similar to a monitor; it prevents the simultaneous execution of a block of code by more than one thread at a time. In fact, the name “mutex” is a shortened form of the term “mutually exclusive.” </p>
<p>Unlike monitors, however, a <strong>mutex</strong> can be used to <strong>synchronize threads across processes</strong>. </p>
<p>A mutex is represented by the <strong>Mutex class</strong>.</p>
<p>When used for <strong>inter-process synchronization</strong>, a mutex is called a <strong>named mutex</strong> because it is to be used in <strong>another application</strong>, and therefore it cannot be <strong>shared by means of a global or static variable</strong>. </p>
<p>It must be given a <strong>name</strong> so that both applications can access the <strong>same mutex object</strong>.</p>
<p>Although a mutex can be used for intra-process thread synchronization, using <strong>Monitor</strong> is generally preferred, because monitors were <strong>designed specifically for the .NET Framework and therefore make better use of resources</strong>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>Mutex class</strong> is a wrapper to a <strong>Win32 construct</strong>. </p>
<p>While it is more powerful than a monitor, a mutex requires interop transitions that are more computationally expensive than those required by the Monitor class. </p>
<p>For an example of using a mutex, see Mutexes.</p>
<h3 id="Interlocked">Interlocked</h3><p>For simple operations on integral numeric data types, synchronizing threads can be accomplished with members of the Interlocked class.</p>
<p>You can use the methods of the Interlocked class to prevent problems that can occur <strong>when multiple threads attempt to simultaneously update or compare the same value</strong>. </p>
<p>The methods of this class let you <strong>safely increment, decrement, exchange, and compare values from any thread</strong>.</p>
<p>The methods of this class help protect against errors that can occur when the scheduler switches contexts while a thread is updating a variable that can be accessed by other threads, or when two threads are executing concurrently on separate processors. </p>
<p>The members of this class do not throw exceptions.</p>
<p>The Increment and Decrement methods increment or decrement a variable and store the resulting value in a single operation. </p>
<p>On most computers, incrementing a variable is not an atomic operation, requiring the following steps:<br>1.Load a value from an instance variable into a register.<br>2.Increment or decrement the value.<br>3.Store the value in the instance variable.</p>
<p>If you do not use Increment and Decrement, a thread can be preempted after executing the first two steps.</p>
<p>Another thread can then execute all three steps. When the first thread resumes execution, it overwrites the value in the instance variable, and the effect of the increment or decrement performed by the second thread is lost.</p>
<p>The Exchange method atomically exchanges the values of the specified variables. </p>
<p>The CompareExchange method combines two operations: comparing two values and storing a third value in one of the variables, based on the outcome of the comparison. </p>
<p>The compare and exchange operations are performed as an atomic operation.</p>

<h3 id="ReaderWriter_Locks">ReaderWriter Locks</h3><p>In some cases, you may want to lock a resource only when data is being written and permit multiple clients to simultaneously read data when data is not being updated. </p>
<p>The <strong>ReaderWriterLock</strong> class enforces <strong>exclusive access to a resource while a thread is modifying the resource</strong>, but it allows <strong>non-exclusive access when reading the resource</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>ReaderWriter</strong> locks are a useful alternative to exclusive locks, which cause other threads to wait, even when those threads do not need to update data.</p>
<h3 id="Deadlocks">Deadlocks</h3><p>Thread synchronization is invaluable in multithreaded applications, but there is always the danger of creating a <strong>deadlock</strong>, where multiple threads are waiting for each other and the application comes to a <strong>halt</strong>. </p>
<p>A deadlock is analogous to a situation in which cars are stopped at a four-way stop and each person is waiting for the other to go. </p>
<p>Avoiding deadlocks is important; the key is careful planning. </p>
<p>You can often predict deadlock situations by <strong>diagramming multithreaded applications before you start coding</strong>.</p>

<p>Think of semaphores as bouncers at a nightclub. There are a dedicated number of people that are allowed in the club at once. If the club is full no one is allowed to enter, but as soon as one person leaves another person might enter.</p>
<p>It’s simply a way to limit the number of consumers for a specific resource. For example, to limit the number of simultaneous calls to a database in an application.</p>
<p>Here is a very pedagogic example in C# :-)</p>

<p>A semaphore with a capacity of one is similar to a Mutex or lock, except that the semaphore has no “owner” — it’s thread-agnostic. </p>
<p>Any thread can call Release on a Semaphore, whereas with Mutex and lock, only the thread that obtained the lock can release it.</p>

<h3 id="HTML_Questions:">HTML Questions:</h3><h4 id="What_does_a_doctype_do?">What does a <code>doctype</code> do?</h4><p>It’s an integral part of HTML as defined in the specification:</p>
<p>A DOCTYPE is a required preamble.</p>
<p>DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications.</p>

<h4 id="What’s_the_difference_between_standards_mode_and_quirks_mode?">What’s the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?</h4><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode" target="_blank" rel="external">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode</a><br><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html</a></p>
<p>The two ’modes’ modern browsers can use to interpret your CSS.</p>
<p>In the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two versions: One for Netscape Navigator, and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer. When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.</p>
<p>There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode. In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. In full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. In almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.</p>
<p><strong>How do browsers determine which mode to use?</strong></p>
<p>For HTML documents, browsers use a DOCTYPE in the beginning of the document to decide whether to handle it in quirks mode or standards mode. To ensure that your page uses full standards mode, make sure that your page has a DOCTYPE </p>
<p>The DOCTYPE shown in the example, <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, is the simplest possible, and the one recommended by HTML5. Earlier versions of the HTML standard recommended other variants, but all existing browsers today will use full standards mode for this DOCTYPE, even the dated Internet Explorer 6. There are no valid reasons to use a more complicated DOCTYPE. If you do use another DOCTYPE, you may risk choosing one which triggers almost standards mode or quirks mode.</p>
<p>Make sure you put the DOCTYPE right at the beginning of your HTML document. Anything before the DOCTYPE, like a comment or an XML declaration will trigger quirks mode in Internet Explorer 9 and older.</p>
<p>In HTML5, the only purpose of the DOCTYPE is to activate full standards mode. Older versions of the HTML standard gave additional meaning to the DOCTYPE, but no browser has ever used the DOCTYPE for anything other than switching between quirks mode and standards mode.</p>
<p><strong>XHTML</strong></p>
<p>If you serve your page as XHTML using the application/xhtml+xml MIME type in the Content-Type HTTP header, you do not need a DOCTYPE to enable standards mode, as such documents always use full standards mode. Note however that serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml will cause Internet Explorer 8 to show a download dialog box for an unknown format instead of displaying your page, as the first version of Internet Explorer with support for XHTML is Internet Explorer 9.</p>
<p>If you serve XHTML-like content using the text/html MIME type, browsers will read it as HTML, and you will need the DOCTYPE to use standards mode.</p>
<p><strong>How do I see which mode is used?</strong></p>
<p>In Firefox, select View Page Info from the context menu, and look for Render Mode.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, press F12, and look for Document Mode.</p>
<h4 id="What’s_the_difference_between_HTML_and_XHTML?">What’s the difference between HTML and XHTML?</h4><p>XHTML is the XML version of HTML.</p>
<p>To understand this answer you have to know what XML is : it’s a markup language designed to format data in a way that’s easy to understand for a human, and also easy to parse for a machine.</p>
<p>XML is also a meta-language. This means that a lot of languages are based on XML, with rules and grammar defined to make a language with specific purpose from XML. Some well-known  examples are OpenMath, MML, XPath, XQuery, …</p>
<p>Now at the beginning of the web, the markup language that was used for web pages was HTML. It looks a lot like XML but it’s not an XML language because it does not respect the XML standard.</p>
<p>Later, XHTML was invented with respect to the XML standard. It is more strict than html because you have to respect all the xml rules (Closing tag for each opening tag, attributes have to have a value etc.)</p>
<p>So the short answer is : xHTML is XML, HTML is not.</p>
<p>XHTML is not so much different from HTML 4.01 standard. The major differences are:</p>
<p><strong>Document Structure</strong><br><em>XHTML DOCTYPE is mandatory
</em>The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory<br><em><html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory<br><strong>XHTML Elements</strong>
</body></title></head></html></em>XHTML elements must be properly nested<br><em>XHTML elements must always be closed
</em>XHTML elements must be in lowercase<br><em>XHTML documents must have one root element<br><strong>XHTML Attributes</strong>
</em>Attribute names must be in lower case<br><em>Attribute values must be quoted
</em>Attribute minimization is forbidden</html></p>
<p>Basically, XHTML is HTML (all the html tags are found in XHTML) that follows the rules of XML (because it is a family of XML).</p>
<h4 id="Are_there_any_problems_with_serving_pages_as_application/xhtml+xml?">Are there any problems with serving pages as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>?</h4><p>When you’re coding XHTML, you should deliver it as application/xhtml+xml. The problem is however, that once you do that, IE 6 &amp; 7 break horribly… For your pages to render properly in those browsers, you’d need to set the mime type to text/html. Some very bright people have thought this problem in the past and came up with a real good solution in PHP, which you can find here: serving up XHTML with the correct MIME type.</p>
<p>WordPress though is always served as XHTML, so if possible, it should send the proper MIME type. I wrote a small plugin that does that: XHTML MIME type plugin. It doesn’t work on this blog yet because of some modifications I’ve done, but I’ll try to get it working.</p>
<p>I use content negotiation to switch between application/xhtml+xml and text/html just like you describe, without noticing any problems with search bots. Strictly though, you should take into account the q values in the accept header that indicates the preference of the user agent to each content type. If a user agent prefers to accept text/html but will accept application/xhtml+xml as an alternate, then for greatest safety you should have the page served as text/html.</p>
<p>One problem with content negotiation (and with serving different content/headers to different user-agents) is proxy servers. Considering the following; I ran into this back in the Netscape 4 days and have been shy of server side sniffing ever since.</p>
<p>User A downloads your page with Firefox, and gets a XHTML/XML Content-Type. The user’s ISP has a proxy server between the user and your site, so this page is now cached.</p>
<p>User B, same ISP, requests your page using Internet Explorer. The request hits the proxy first, the proxy says “hey, I have that page, here it is; as application/xhtml+xml”. User B is prompted to download the file (as IE will download anything sent as application/xhtml+xml.</p>
<p>You can get around this particular issue by using the Vary Header, as described in this 456 Berea Street article. I also assume that proxy servers have gotten a bit smarter about auto detecting these things.</p>
<p>Here’s where the CF that is HTML/XHTML starts to creep in. When you use content negotiation to serve application/xhtml+xml to one set of user-agents, and text/html to another set of user agents, you’re relying on all the proxies between your server and your users to be well behaved.</p>
<p>Even if all the proxy servers in the world were smart enough to recognize the Vary header (they aren’t) you still have to contend with the computer janitors of the world. There are a lot of smart, talented, and dedicated IT professionals in the world. There are more not so smart people who spend their days double clicking installer applications and thinking “The Internet” is that blue E in their menu. A mis-configured proxy could still improperly cache pages and headers, leaving you out of luck.</p>

<h4 id="What_are_data-_attributes_good_for?">What are <code>data-</code> attributes good for?</h4><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes" target="_blank" rel="external">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes</a></p>
<p>HTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as classList, non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or setUserData.</p>
<p>HTML Syntax<br>The syntax is simple. Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute. Say you have an article and you want to store some extra information that doesn’t have any visual representation. Just use data attributes for that:</p>
<figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">article</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attribute">id</span>=<span class="value">"electriccars"</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attribute">data-columns</span>=<span class="value">"3"</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attribute">data-index-number</span>=<span class="value">"12314"</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attribute">data-parent</span>=<span class="value">"cars"</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">article</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Javasript Access</p>
<p>Reading the values of these attributes out in Javasript is also very simple. You could use getAttribute() with their full HTML name to read them, but the standard defines a simpler way: a DOMStringMap you can read out via a dataset property.</p>
<p>To get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note that dashes are converted to camelCase).</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">var article = document.getElementById(&#39;electriccars&#39;);&#10; &#10;article.dataset.columns // &#34;3&#34;&#10;article.dataset.indexNumber // &#34;12314&#34;&#10;article.dataset.parent // &#34;cars&#34;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Each property is a string and can be read and written. In the above case setting article.dataset.columns = 5 would change that attribute to “5”.</p>
<p>CSS Access<br>Note that, as data attributes are plain HTML attributes, you can even access them from CSS. For example to show the parent data on the article you can use generated content in CSS with the attr() function:</p>
<figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="rule"><span class="attribute">article</span>:<span class="value">:before &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  content: <span class="function">attr</span>(data-parent)</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">You</span> <span class="tag">can</span> <span class="tag">also</span> <span class="tag">use</span> <span class="tag">the</span> <span class="tag">attribute</span> <span class="tag">selectors</span> <span class="tag">in</span> <span class="tag">CSS</span> <span class="tag">to</span> <span class="tag">change</span> <span class="tag">styles</span> <span class="tag">according</span> <span class="tag">to</span> <span class="tag">the</span> <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">data</span>:<span class="value"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">article[data-columns=<span class="string">'3'</span>] &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  width: <span class="number">400px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">article</span><span class="attr_selector">[data-columns='4']</span> <span class="rules">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">width</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">600px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>You can see all this working together. </p>
<p>Data attributes can also be stored to contain information that is constantly changing, like scores in a game. Using the CSS selectors and Javasript access here this allows you to build some nifty effects without having to write your own display routines. See this screencast for an example using generated content and CSS transitions (JSBin example).</p>
<p>Since data values are strings, all values must have quotes or else the styling won’t have any effect.</p>
<h4 id="Consider_HTML5_as_an_open_web_platform-_What_are_the_building_blocks_of_HTML5?">Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?</h4><h4 id="Describe_the_difference_between_a_cookie,_sessionStorage_and_localStorage-">Describe the difference between a <code>cookie</code>, <code>sessionStorage</code> and <code>localStorage</code>.</h4><p>localStorage and sessionStorage are both so-called WebStorages and features of HTML5.</p>
<p>localStorage stores information as long as the user does not delete them.</p>
<p>sessionStorage stores information as long as the session goes. Usually until the user closes the tab/browser.</p>
<p>cookies are simply cookies, which are supported by older browsers and usually are a fallback for frameworks that use the above mentioned WebStorages.</p>
<p>In contrast cookies can store way less information then WebStorages and the information in WebStorages is never transferred to the server.</p>
<p>This is an extremely broad scope question, and a lot of the pros/cons will be contextual to the situation.</p>
<p>In all cases these storage mechanisms will be specific to an individual browser on an individual computer/device. Any requirement to store data on an ongoing basis across sessions will need to involve your application server side - most likely using a database, but possibly XML or a text/CSV file.</p>
<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all client storage solutions. Session data is held on the server where it remains under your direct control.</p>
<p>localStorage and sessionStorage<br>localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name persists) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the window is closed) - it does however survive page reloads (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network).</p>
<p>Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.</p>
<p>localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security related data within applications.</p>
<p>Cookies<br>This is also true for cookies, these can be trivially tampered with by the user, and data can also be read from them in plain text - so if you are wanting to store sensitive data then session is really your only option. If you are not using SSL, cookie information can also be intercepted in transit, especially on an open wifi.</p>
<p>On the positive side cookies can have a degree of protection applied from security risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)/Script injection by setting an HTTP only flag which means modern (supporting) browsers will prevent access to the cookies and values from Javasript (this will also prevent your own, legitimate, Javasript from accessing them). This is especially important with authentication cookies, which are used to store a token containing details of the user who is logged on - if you have a copy of that cookie then for all intents and purposes you become that user as far as the web application is concerned, and have the same access to data and functionality the user has.</p>
<p>As cookies are used for authentication purposes and persistence of user data, all cookies valid for a page are sent from the browser to the server for every request to the same domain - this includes the original page request, any subsequent Ajax requests, all images, stylesheets, scripts and fonts. For this reason cookies should not be used to store large amounts of information. Browser may also impose limits on the size of information that can be stored in cookies. Typically cookies are used to store identifying tokens for authentication, session and advertising tracking. The tokens are typically not human readable information in and of themselves, but encrypted identifiers linked to your application or database.</p>
<p>localStorage vs. sessionStorage vs. Cookies<br>In terms of capabilities, cookies only allow you to store strings. sessionStorage and localStorage allow you to store Javasript primitives but not Objects or Arrays (it is possible to JSON serialise them to store them using the APIs). Session storage will generally allow you to store any primitives or objects supported by your Server Side language/framework.</p>
<p>Client-side vs. Server-side<br>As HTTP is a stateless protocol - web applications have no way of identifying a user from previous visits on returning to the web site - session data usually relies on a cookie token to identify the user for repeat visits (although rarely URL parameters may be used for the same purpose). Data will usually have a sliding expiry time (renewed each time the user visits), and depending on your server/framework data will either be stored in-process (meaning data will be lost if the web server crashes or is restarted) or externally in a state server or database. This is also necessary when using a web-farm (more than one server for a given website).</p>
<p>As session data is completely controlled by your application (server side) it is the best place for anything sensitive or secure in nature.</p>
<p>The obvious disadvantage with server side data is scalability - server resources are required for each user for the duration of the session, and that any data needed client side must be sent with each request. As the server has no way of knowing if a user navigates to another site or closes their browser, session data must expire after a given time to avoid all server resources being taken up by abandoned sessions. When using session data you should therefore be aware of the possibility that data will have expired and been lost, especially on pages with long forms. It will also be lost if the user deletes their cookies or switches browsers/devices.</p>
<p>Some web frameworks/developers use hidden HTML inputs to persist data from one page of a form to another to avoid session expiration.</p>
<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all subject to “same-origin” rules which means browsers should prevent access to the data except from the domain that set the information to start with.</p>

<p>Let’s start by defining what script tag without any attributes does. The HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it’s external). The script will then be executed before parsing is resumed.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/script.svg" alt="script"></p>
<figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">script</span> <span class="attribute">async</span>=<span class="value">""</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.</p>

<p>defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. defer scripts are also guarenteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/script-defer.svg" alt="script"></p>
<p>When should I use what? Typically you want to use async where possible, then defer then no attribute. Here are some general rules to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the script is modular and does not rely on any scripts then use async.</li>
<li>If the script relies upon or is relied upon by another script then use defer.</li>
<li>If the script is small and is relied upon by an async script then use an inline script with no attributes placed above the async scripts.</li>
</ul>

Do you know any exceptions?</h4><p>The reasoning for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> at the top is browsers have to reflow the layout as CSS files load (if they’re not in the <head>) moving elements around while the user is trying to interact with the page. For script tag files at the end, browsers have to (in most cases) block processing the HTML while a Javasript file is loaded and run in case it makes in Write() calls (which you’re not supposed to do anymore these days); if the script tag is at the end, the browser can still display all of the HTML above the script tags while it is processing the Javasript. </head></p>
<p>Just to add on to what jdelStrother has mentioned about w3 specs and ARTstudio about browser rendering.</p>
<p>It is recommended because when you have the CSS declared before <body> starts, your styles has actually loaded already. So very quickly users see something appear on their screen (e.g. background colors). If not, users see blank screen for some time before the CSS reaches the user.</body></p>
<p>Also, if you leave the the styles somewhere in the <body>, the browser has to re-render the page (new and old when loading) when the styles declared has been parsed.</body></p>

<h3 id="JS_Questions:">JS Questions:</h3><h4 id="Explain_event_delegation">Explain event delegation</h4><p>DOM event delegation is a mechanism of responding to ui-events via a single common parent rather than each child, through the magic of event “bubbling” (aka event propagation).</p>
<p>When an event is triggered on an element, the following occurs:</p>
<p>The event is dispatched to its target  EventTarget and any event listeners found there are triggered. Bubbling events will then trigger any additional event listeners found by following the EventTarget’s parent chain upward, checking for any event listeners registered on each successive EventTarget. This upward propagation will continue up to and including the Document.<br>Event bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in browsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn). This is event delegation. Here’s an example of it in practice:</p>
<figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">ul</span> <span class="attribute">onclick</span>=<span class="value">"alert(event.type + '!')"</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">li</span>&gt;</span>One<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">li</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">li</span>&gt;</span>Two<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">li</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">li</span>&gt;</span>Three<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">li</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">ul</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>With that example if you were to click on any of the child <li> nodes, you would see an alert of “click!”, even though there is no click handler bound to the </li><li> you clicked on. If we bound onclick=”…” to each </li><li> you would get the same effect.</li></p>
<p>So what’s the benefit?</p>
<p>Imagine you now have a need to dynamically add new <li> items to the above list via DOM manipulation:</li></p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">var newLi = document.createElement(&#39;li&#39;);&#10;newLi.innerHTML = &#39;Four&#39;;&#10;myUL.appendChild(newLi);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Without using event delegation you would have to “rebind” the “onclick” event handler to the new <li> element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. With event delegation you don’t need to do anything. Just add the new </li><li> to the list and you’re done.</li></p>
<p>This is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound to many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or removed in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings can be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, and code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be decoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.</p>
<p>Another benefit to event delegation is that the total memory footprint used by event listeners goes down (since the number of event bindings go down). It may not make much of a difference to small pages that unload often (i.e. user’s navigate to different pages often). But for long-lived applications it can be significant. There are some really difficult-to-track-down situations when elements removed from the DOM still claim memory (i.e. they leak), and often this leaked memory is tied to an event binding. With event delegation you’re free to destroy child elements without risk of forgetting to “unbind” their event listeners (since the listener is on the ancestor). These types of memory leaks can then be contained (if not eliminated, which is freaking hard to do sometimes. IE I’m looking at you).</p>
<p>Here are some better concrete code examples of event delegation:</p>

<h4 id="Explain_how_this_works_in_Javasript">Explain how <code>this</code> works in Javasript</h4><p><a href="http://davidshariff.com/blog/Javasript-this-keyword/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://davidshariff.com/blog/Javasript-this-keyword/</a></p>
<p>Javasript’s <code>this</code> Keyword</p>
<p>A commonly used feature of Javasript is the “this” keyword, but it is often also one of the most confused and misinterpreted features of the language. What does “this” actually mean and how is it decided?</p>
<p>This article tries to clear up the confusion and explain the answer in a clear fashion.</p>
<p>The <code>this</code> keyword is not new to those who have programmed in other languages, and more often than not it refers to the new object created when instantiating a class via it’s constructor. For example, if I have a class Boat(), which has a method moveBoat(), when refering to “this” inside of the moveBoat() method, we are actually accessing the newly created object of Boat().</p>
<p>In Javasript, we also have this concept inside a Function constructor when it is invoked using the “new” keyword, however it is not the only rule and “this” can often refer to a different object from a different execution context. If you are not familiar with Javasript’s execution context, I recommend you read my other post on the topic here. Enough talking, let’s see some Javasript examples:</p>

<p>Whenever you use the keyword <code>this</code> in the global context (not inside a function), it always refers to the global object. Now let’s look at the value of “this” inside a function:</p>

<p>It gets created on the global object (that is, the window), thus it operates in a different space as the declared variables.</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">var declaredVariable = 1;&#10;&#10;function scoppedVariables() &#123;&#10;  undeclaredVariable = 1;&#10;  var declaredVariable = 2;&#10;&#125;&#10;&#10;scoppedVariables();&#10;&#10;undeclaredVariable; // 1&#10;declaredVariable; // 1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that the typeof returns “undefined”, therefore undefined is a primitive type.</p>
<p>The fix for an undefined variable or function is easy, simply define it:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">var definedVariable = &#39;test&#39;;&#10;typeof definedVariable; // &#34;string&#34;&#10;&#10;function definedFunction()&#123;&#10;  return &#34;I&#39;m defined!&#34;&#10;&#125;&#10;typeof definedFunction // &#34;function&#34;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>You can know if a variable is undefined with the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">if (typeof(variable) !== &#34;undefined&#34;) &#123;&#10;  console.log(&#39;variable is not undefined&#39;);&#10;&#125; else &#123;&#10;  console.log(&#39;variable is undefined&#39;);&#10;&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You probably don’t often purposefully define a variable to null, but it may be the return value of a function. Often you’ll need to gaurd against null values in your code.</p>
<p>You can know if a variable is null with the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">if( variable === null ) &#123;&#10;  console.log(&#39;variable is null&#39;);&#10;&#125; else &#123;&#10;  console.log(&#39;variable is not null&#39;);&#10;&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I think the order “undeclared, undefined, and null” makes sense since it’s increasing order of certainty.</p>
<p><em>undeclared variables don’t even exist
</em><code>undefined</code> variables exist, but don’t have anything assigned to them using “typeof” to check.<br>*<code>null</code> variables exist and have <code>null</code> assigned to them using “!” mark to check.</p>

<p>Javasript has both strict and type-converting equality comparison. For strict equality the objects being compared must have the same type and:</p>
<p><em>Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
</em>Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal (have the same number value). NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.<br><em>Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
</em>Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.<br>*Null and Undefined types are == (but not ===). [I.e. (Null==Undefined) is true but (Null===Undefined) is false]</p>
